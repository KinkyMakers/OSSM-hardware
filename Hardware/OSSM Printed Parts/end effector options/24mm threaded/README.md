# 24mm Threaded Option

This option is three parts:


- Rail adapter ( 24mm linear rail adapter.step )
- Jam Nut ( in the DoubleDouble file )
- Your choice of end effector
    - DoubleDouble ( double double to the moon 24mm v1.step )
    - OSSM Tie down platten ( OSSM Tie Down and Suction Plate v2.step )


### Printing of the parts

Warning! I've had accuracy issues with my printer while developing this so I am unsure if fitting issues are due to that or the tolerances of the drawn items. 

Please follow these steps for tuning in your build:

1) Print the rail adapter and fit it to your linear rail. 
2) Print the Jam nut - I have had the most success printing it with X&Y being increased to 105% and Z staying at 100% scaling.

3) Test fit Jam Nut
4) Use same print settings for DoubleDouble 


## Installation on the rail

Use (2) M3x16mm cap head screws + nuts to attach the theaded adapter to the shaft of your OSSM.

## DoubleDouble and Jam Nut Install

1) Thread on Jam nut to about halfway
2) Thread on DoubleDouble until it bottoms out (gently, no need to crank down)
3) *optional* Back off the DoubleDouble if orientation of the pass-thru matters for your application
4) Thread the Jam nut to the back of the DoubleDouble **hand tight only** keep going until hand tight
5) ENJOY
