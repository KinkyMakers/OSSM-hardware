# Mounting Options

There are several options for mounting your OSSM! You will find descriptions of the mounts below, and the files and instructions on how to build them in the folders above. 

The **OSSM Basic Mount** is the "official" design and is available to [purchase from Research and Desire](https://shop.researchanddesire.com/collections/all/products/ossm-basic-mount). It is mostly 3D printed and is screwed down to a piece of wood, furniture, shelf etc. It uses the 3D printed middle pivot and threaded handles. Current design relies on sourcing a length of 3030 extrusion (1.5" will also work). This is one of the less expensive options. Picture below.

The **Shicks 4040 mount** was created by discord community member Shicks101 (Thanks!) and is made out of Aluminum Extrusion and 3D printed parts. It supports a high level of articulation and variability in height. The parts are easy to get, but it is a little more costly. You may need to weigh it down with dumbbells or sandbags. Picture below.

The **OSSM Extrusion Mount** is an extrusion based mount that is simple to print and assemble requiring no cutting tools if you can get extrusion at the correct length. It uses the standard middle pivot and only a few 3D printed pieces.

**Emma's mod** is for the use of a long Nema23. This mount is mostly 3D printed and was created for a different machine, but will still work. (no photo available)  


There are a few more mounting options created by community members in the Discord that are not present here in the repository. Some are motorized! Or if none of these fit your use case, you could create your own and share it with the community.
