# Printing the parts!

### Print Settings
All parts can be printed without need for support material!

The OSSM base is the most structurally important piece, recommend using 6 perimeters/shells and 20-30% infill. If you don't need to optimize material, this is a good setting for all parts.
The end effectors should also have a good number of perimeters.

Body Middle and Body Cover are less critical for perimeters.

### Toy Mounting
Default mounting uses a 24mm thread on the rail to allow you to swap between different toy adapters. Lock the toy adapter using the jam nut to keep it secure.

You can use the double double with vac-u-lock compatible toys.

Toys with a flange can be mounted on the flange base and secured with a toy ring that fits your toy. Use some string/paracord/thin rope to connect the ring to the flange for a secure hold.

### Rear tensioner 
The default tensioner fit has been significantly improved and now grips quality belts without slipping. The SATC Improved Tensioner V3 allows you to get a tight grip on the belt and adjust it's length while installed. It requires two 20mm M3 hex head screws, two M3 nuts and a 20mm M5 hex head bolt that is used for additional tensioning.  Note this design contains two parts that are printed in place. 

### Remote Body
The standard remote body accepts M4 screws, but you can also heat set m3 inserts into the thread hole. There is also another file without the modelled threads to allow this as well.
