# Modified 4040 parts

![image](ossm.jpg)

These parts are modified to fit the 4040 profiles you can buy at https://www.aluxprofile.com/aluminium-slot-profile-4040-black/a3757 or https://www.aluxprofile.com/aluminium-slot-profile-4040/a3619.

These have a 0.2mm offset from the extrusion, so they are a tight fit and will require some force to be put into the extrusion.
