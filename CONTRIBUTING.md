# Contributing to OSSM (Open Source Sex Machine)

Welcome to the OSSM project, run by the Kinky Makers! We‚Äôre excited to have you contribute to the world‚Äôs most open, hackable, and community-driven sex machine. Please read this guide to help you get started and make your contributions as smooth as possible.

## üìö Project Overview

- **Project Home:** [Kinky Makers OSSM Documentation](https://kinky-makers.gitbook.io/open-source-sex-machine/software/docs)
- **Main Repository:** This repo contains hardware, software, and documentation for OSSM.
- **Community:** [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/MmpT9xE) for support, discussion, and collaboration.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/OSSM-hardware.git
   cd OSSM-hardware/Software
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   - For firmware: [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) (recommended) or Arduino IDE
   - For hardware: See the [Bill of Materials](../README.md#bill-of-materials)
3. **Set up your environment:**
   - PlatformIO: Open the `Software` folder in VSCode and install the PlatformIO extension.
   - Arduino IDE: Open the `.ino` file in `src/` and copy libraries from `lib/` to your Arduino libraries folder.
   - See [Software/README.md](Software/README.md) for more details.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Coding Standards

- **C++ Formatting:**
  - Code must be formatted using `clang-format` (see `.clang-format` in `Software/`).
  - Pre-commit hooks are set up via `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to enforce formatting. Install with:
    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
    ```
- **EditorConfig:**
  - The project uses `.editorconfig` for consistent indentation, line endings, and file encoding.
- **General Guidelines:**
  - Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
  - Comment your code where necessary.
  - Follow existing code structure and naming conventions.

## üß™ Testing

- **Test Framework:** Unity (for C++)
- **Test Structure:**
  - Add new tests in `Software/test/` as a new directory: `test_<feature>`
  - Each test directory should have a `main.cpp` file. See [Software/test/README.md](Software/test/README.md) for a template.
- **Running Tests:**
  - From the `Software` directory, run:
    ```bash
    pio test -e test
    ```

## üå≥ Branching & Pull Requests

- **Branching:**
  - Follow the [Git Branching Strategy](Software/docs/Git%20Branching%20Strategy) if contributing regularly.
  - For small fixes, branch from `main` or the latest development branch.
- **Pull Requests:**
  1. Ensure your branch is up to date with the latest `main`.
  2. Run all tests and ensure they pass.
  3. Open a pull request with a clear description of your changes and reference any related issues.
  4. Be responsive to code review feedback.

## üõü Getting Help

- **Documentation:** [Project Docs](https://kinky-makers.gitbook.io/open-source-sex-machine/software/docs)
- **FAQ:** [FAQ.md](FAQ.md)
- **Discord:** [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/MmpT9xE)
- **Issues:** If you find a bug or have a feature request, open an issue in the repo.

## üí° Tips for Contributors

- Be respectful and inclusive‚Äîthis is a diverse, welcoming community.
- If you‚Äôre unsure, open a draft PR or ask in Discord before spending lots of time on a big change.
- Hardware, software, and documentation contributions are all welcome!

Thank you for helping make OSSM better for everyone!
