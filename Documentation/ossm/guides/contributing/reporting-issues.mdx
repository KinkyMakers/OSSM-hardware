Found a bug or design problem? Reporting issues helps improve OSSM for everyone. This guide explains where and how to submit technical issues effectively.

## What to report on GitHub

Submit issues to the [OSSM GitHub repository](https://github.com/KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware/issues) for:

- **Software bugs** — Firmware crashes, unexpected behavior, or code errors
- **Hardware design issues** — Problems with CAD models, printed part fit, or mechanical design
- **Documentation errors** — Incorrect instructions, missing information, or broken links
- **Feature requests** — Ideas for improvements to the design or software

<Warning>
If you purchased parts or a pre-built assembly from Research and Desire, contact their support team directly for order issues, shipping problems, or product defects. GitHub issues are for open source design and code problems only.
</Warning>

## How to submit a good issue

<Steps>
<Step title="Search existing issues">
Check if someone has already reported the problem. If so, add your details as a comment rather than opening a duplicate issue.
</Step>

<Step title="Gather information">
Collect relevant details before submitting:

- **For software issues** — Firmware version, error messages, and steps to reproduce
- **For hardware issues** — Photos, measurements, and print settings used
- **For all issues** — Clear description of expected vs. actual behavior
</Step>

<Step title="Open a new issue">
Go to the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware/issues/new) and provide:

- A clear, descriptive title
- Detailed steps to reproduce the problem
- Your environment details (hardware version, firmware version, etc.)
- Screenshots or photos if applicable
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The more detail you provide, the faster the community can help resolve the issue. Include error messages verbatim and attach relevant files when possible.
</Tip>
