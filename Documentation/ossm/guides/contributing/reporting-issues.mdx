description: "How to report bugs, design problems, and technical issues with OSSM hardware or software"
---

Found a bug or design problem? Reporting issues helps improve OSSM for everyone. This guide explains where to submit issues and how to write reports that maintainers can act on quickly.

## Where to report

- GitHub (open source design and code)
  - Use the OSSM GitHub repository issues for:
    - Software bugs — firmware crashes, unexpected behavior, or code errors
    - Hardware design issues — CAD model problems, printed part fit, mechanical interference
    - Documentation errors — incorrect instructions, missing information, broken links
    - Feature requests — ideas for improvements to hardware, firmware, or UX
  - Repository issues: https://github.com/KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware/issues

<Warning>
If you purchased parts or a pre-built assembly from Research and Desire, use support for order issues, shipping questions, missing items, or product defects. These are not GitHub issues.
<br />
<a href="mailto:support@researchanddesire.com">Contact support</a> (typical reply within 1 business day).
</Warning>

<Warning>
Security or safety vulnerabilities: do not post publicly. <a href="mailto:support@researchanddesire.com">Contact support</a> and include “Security report” in the subject. Provide a minimal, reproducible description and affected versions.
</Warning>

<Note>
If your problem is with the Wireless Remote (RADR) pairing or behavior, review the <a href="/research-and-desire-remote/quick-start">RADR Quick Start</a> first.
</Note>

## Submit a high‑quality issue

<Steps>
<Step title="Search existing issues">
Check whether the problem is already reported. If you find a match, add your details (device/firmware versions, logs, photos) as a comment instead of opening a duplicate.
</Step>

<Step title="Gather the right information">
Collect these details before you file:

- For software/firmware
  - Exact firmware version and board revision
  - Steps to reproduce (numbered, minimal)
  - What you expected vs. what actually happened
  - Any on-screen or serial error messages
  - Whether you control OSSM via wired remote or wireless remote
  - If you recently updated, note how you flashed it: see <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/flashing-your-ossm">Flashing your OSSM</a>

- For hardware/mechanical
  - Clear photos or short video showing the issue
  - Specific part names and version (e.g., printed part STL name, rev)
  - Measurements (calipers), materials, printer settings (nozzle, layer height, infill, filament)
  - Assembly or wiring references if relevant (e.g., <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/ossm-electronics/wiring-your-gold-motor">Motor Wiring</a>)

- For all issues
  - Environment details: OSSM hardware version, power supply, peripherals
  - Links to any related discussions or prior issues
</Step>

<Step title="Create a minimal reproduction (if applicable)">
Reduce the problem to the smallest set of steps or configuration that triggers it. Attach sample configs, short pattern files, or gcode-like snippets as needed. This helps maintainers reproduce and fix the issue faster.
</Step>

<Step title="Open a new issue on GitHub">
Go to https://github.com/KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware/issues/new and include:

- A clear, descriptive title
- Numbered steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Environment and version details
- Screenshots, photos, logs, or short videos

<Tip>
Paste error messages verbatim and attach files rather than pasting large blobs inline. Redact personal data.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Follow up and verify the fix">
Subscribe to your issue and respond to maintainer questions. When a fix or workaround is provided, test it and confirm the outcome. Close the issue when resolved.

<Check>
You should have an issue number and notifications enabled. If you <a href="mailto:support@researchanddesire.com">contacted support</a>, check for a confirmation email within 1 business day.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Include version numbers everywhere: printed part revision, board revision, and firmware version. This is the single most common blocker for quick triage.

<Info>
Need help deciding whether something belongs in GitHub or support? If money changed hands (orders, shipments, defects, warranty), <a href="mailto:support@researchanddesire.com">contact support</a>. If it’s about the open source design, CAD, firmware, or docs, open a GitHub issue.
