description: "Join the OSSM community as a contributor and help improve the project's hardware and software"
---

OSSM is built by a global community of makers, engineers, and enthusiasts. Whether you're fixing a typo or designing new features, every contribution matters. This guide walks you through how to start contributing with confidence and get your work reviewed and merged.

## Before you start

<Info>
Set yourself up for success by preparing the basics before making changes.
</Info>

- A GitHub account and a local Git setup
- Familiarity with pull requests (PRs) and branching workflows
- The tools required for your contribution area:
  - Software: a C/C++ toolchain and your preferred IDE/editor
  - Hardware: your preferred CAD/PCB tools and access to a printer/fab as needed
  - Documentation: a Markdown/MDX-capable editor

Familiarize yourself with the repository structure:

- Software — firmware and control code in the `/Software` directory
- Hardware — CAD files, PCB designs, and printed parts in their respective directories
- Documentation — guides and references in the `/Documentation` directory

## Types of contributions

- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- New features and hardware iterations
- Documentation updates and examples
- Issue triage, testing, and review feedback

<Tip>
Small, incremental changes are easier to review and merge than large, multi-purpose PRs.
</Tip>

## Contribution workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Find something to work on">
Browse open issues to find something that interests you. Issues labeled <strong>good first issue</strong> are ideal starting points for new contributors.

<Check>
You’ve picked an issue or created one to discuss your idea before building a solution.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Fork and clone the repository">
Create your own fork on GitHub, then clone it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/OSSM-hardware.git
cd OSSM-hardware
```

<Check>
Your local repository is set up and you can run basic build or validation steps relevant to your contribution area.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Create a branch for your changes">
Use a descriptive branch name that reflects your work:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/motor-calibration-bug
```

<Tip>
Use short, consistent prefixes like `fix/`, `feat/`, or `docs/` to make your intent clear.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Make your changes">
Follow the contribution guidelines for your area of work:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Hardware Contribution Guide" icon="wrench" href="/ossm/Hardware/standard-printed-parts/contribution-guidelines">
Standards for CAD models, printed parts, and mechanical design.
</Card>

<Card title="Software Contribution Guide" icon="code" href="https://github.com/KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware/tree/main/Software">
Coding standards, testing requirements, and firmware guidelines.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Keep changes focused on a single goal. If you discover unrelated issues, open separate PRs.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Test and verify locally">
- Software: build and bench-test; add or update unit tests if available
- Hardware: validate dimensions, tolerances, and fit; include images or test prints where possible
- Documentation: build or preview the docs locally and fix broken links

<Check>
Your change works as intended and does not break existing functionality.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Commit your changes">
Write clear, conventional commit messages so reviewers understand your intent:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: correct motor calibration routine to prevent stall at startup"
```

<Note>
Group related changes into logical commits. Avoid mixing refactors and feature changes in one commit.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Push your branch and open a pull request">
Push your branch and open a pull request on GitHub. Include:

- A clear description of what you changed and why
- References to any related issues (for example, "Fixes #123")
- Screenshots, test results, or photos of hardware prints if applicable

<Check>
Your PR description helps reviewers reproduce your results and understand your approach.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Collaborate during review and iterate">
Maintainers may request changes—this is a normal part of keeping quality high. Address feedback with follow-up commits on the same branch.

<Check>
All review comments are resolved, CI (if applicable) is passing, and your PR is ready to merge.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Getting help

If you get stuck or have questions:

- Ask in your pull request — maintainers and contributors can help
- Join the community Discord — connect with other makers for real-time help
- Check existing documentation — many common questions are already answered

<Note>
We welcome contributors of all skill levels. Don’t hesitate to ask questions—the community is here to help you succeed.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="I’m seeing merge conflicts when I open my PR">
- Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only
git checkout your-branch
git rebase main
```
- Resolve conflicts locally, run your tests, and force-push the updated branch.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="CI or checks are failing">
- Read the failure logs to identify the exact step that failed
- Verify formatting/linting requirements and re-run tests locally
- Ask for guidance in the PR if the failure isn’t clear
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Hardware part doesn’t fit or prints poorly">
- Re-check critical dimensions and tolerances
- Share photos and notes in your PR so others can reproduce and advise
</Accordion>
