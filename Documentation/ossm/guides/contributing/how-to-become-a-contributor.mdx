OSSM is built by a global community of makers, engineers, and enthusiasts. Whether you're fixing a typo or designing new features, every contribution matters. This guide walks you through the process of becoming a contributor.

## Before you start

Familiarize yourself with the project structure:

- **Software** — Firmware and control code in the `/Software` directory
- **Hardware** — CAD files, PCB designs, and printed parts in their respective directories
- **Documentation** — Guides and references in the `/Documentation` directory

## Contribution workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Find something to work on">
Browse [open issues](https://github.com/KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware/issues) to find something that interests you. Issues labeled **good first issue** are ideal starting points for new contributors.

<Tip>
If you have an idea that isn't already an issue, open one first to discuss it with maintainers before investing significant time.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Fork and clone the repository">
Create your own fork on GitHub, then clone it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/OSSM-hardware.git
cd OSSM-hardware
```
</Step>

<Step title="Create a branch for your changes">
Use a descriptive branch name that reflects your work:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/motor-calibration-bug
```
</Step>

<Step title="Make your changes">
Follow the contribution guidelines for your area of work:

</Card>

<Card title="Software Contribution Guide" icon="code" href="/Software/README">
Coding standards, testing requirements, and firmware guidelines.
</Card>
</CardGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Submit a pull request">
Push your branch and open a pull request on GitHub. Include:

- A clear description of what you changed and why
- Reference to any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- Screenshots or test results if applicable

<Check>
Maintainers will review your pull request and may request changes. This is a normal part of the process—it helps maintain code quality.

## Getting help

If you get stuck or have questions:

- **Ask in the pull request** — Maintainers and other contributors can help
- **Join the community Discord** — Connect with other makers for real-time help
- **Check existing documentation** — Many common questions are already answered

<Note>
We appreciate contributors of all skill levels. Don't hesitate to ask questions—the community is here to help you succeed.
