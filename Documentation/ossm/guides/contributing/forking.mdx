description: "Learn when to fork the OSSM repository and how to contribute your improvements back to the project"

Forking allows you to experiment freely with changes without affecting the main project. You can create your own version of OSSM, test new ideas, and when you're ready, contribute your improvements back to the community.

## When to fork

Fork the repository when you want to:

- **Experiment with major changes** — Test new features or architectural changes without impacting the main codebase
- **Build a custom version** — Create a specialized variant of OSSM for your specific needs
- **Learn and explore** — Use the codebase as a learning resource while making your own modifications

<Tip>
If you have a smaller improvement or bug fix, consider [opening a pull request](/ossm/guides/contributing/how-to-become-a-contributor) directly instead of forking.
</Tip>

## Contributing your changes back

When you've built something you're proud of, we welcome your contributions back to the main repository. Your experiments and innovations help make OSSM better for everyone.

<Note>
We encourage experimentation, breaking things, and having fun. The open source community thrives when people explore new ideas—let's build something OSSM together.
