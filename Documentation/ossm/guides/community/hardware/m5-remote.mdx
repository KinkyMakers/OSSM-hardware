The M5 Remote is a community-developed wireless controller built on the M5Stack platform. It features four rotary encoders for direct control of speed, depth, stroke, and sensation, plus a touchscreen display for visual feedback.

<Info>
**Official firmware support coming soon.** Until then, this remote requires the community [OSSM-Stroke firmware](https://github.com/ortlof/OSSM-Stroke)—it does not work with the current official OSSM firmware.
