[xToys](https://xtoys.app) is a cross-platform sex toy control platform that lets you connect, control, and automate your smart devices — including your OSSM.

The xToys team has worked with us to create a seamless Bluetooth integration, giving you access to powerful features beyond what the standard OSSM remote offers.

## What you can do with xToys

- **Control OSSM via Bluetooth** – No WiFi required, just pair and play
- **Build complex scenes** – Chain together actions, patterns, and triggers
- **Coordinate multiple toys** – Sync your OSSM with other Bluetooth devices for synchronized experiences
- **Use pre-built patterns** – Access community-created patterns or design your own
- **Script custom interactions** – Create sophisticated automations with xToys' scripting engine

<Info>
xToys is a third-party, closed source platform maintained independently by the xToys team. While we love it and helped build the integration, it is not officially supported by the OSSM project.
