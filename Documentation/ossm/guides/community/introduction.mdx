The Kinky Makers community has created an impressive collection of extensions, integrations, and modifications for the OSSM. Many contributors have forked the repository and invented exciting add-ons that expand what you can do with your build.

This section collects the most production-ready OSSM extensions. While we cannot cover every community project, you will find the most reliable and well-tested options here.

<Warning>
Only the official 3D printed parts, official firmware, and standard build are supported by Kinky Makers and Research And Desire. If you choose to use custom components, review the [safety guidelines](/ossm/guides/housekeeping/safety) before proceeding.
