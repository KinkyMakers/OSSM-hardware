## What This Means for You

When you contribute to this GitHub repository, your contributions fall under the same CERN-OHL-S v2 license. You can find the complete license text in the [licence documentation](/guides/housekeeping/open-source/licence).

<Info>
The strongly reciprocal nature of CERN-OHL-S v2 ensures that derivative works remain open source, protecting the community's collective efforts.
