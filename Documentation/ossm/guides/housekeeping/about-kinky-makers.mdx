## Who we are

Kinky Makers is a volunteer-run community of builders, designers, and tinkerers exploring open hardware and playful robotics. Founded by Alex and James in Toronto, Canada in 2020, the group began as an in‑person makerspace meetup and has grown into a global online community collaborating on open projects like the Open Source Sex Machine (OSSM).

<Info>
We blend engineering with kink‑positive curiosity in a safety‑first, judgment‑free environment. You’ll find conversations about materials, mechanics, firmware, and consent‑centered setup that help you learn and share confidently.
</Info>

## What we do

- Maintain and iterate on OSSM through community feedback and testing
- Share build logs, mods, patterns, and firmware experiments
- Mentor newcomers with beginner‑friendly guides and examples
- Coordinate sprints and usability testing across hardware and software (including RADR)

<Tip>
New here? Start by updating or flashing your device, then explore wireless control and supported devices.

## Our mission and values

Our mission is to make advanced pleasure tech accessible, safe, and open. We focus on:

- Openness: open source designs, transparent roadmaps, and reproducible builds
- Safety: conservative defaults, clear guardrails, and “stop when unsure” culture
- Privacy: respect for user data and practical security guidance
- Inclusivity: welcoming space for all identities and skill levels
- Learning: hands‑on education, documentation, and peer support

<Warning>
Always follow device safety guidelines and play within your limits. If something feels unsafe, stop and reassess before proceeding.
</Warning>

## Get involved

- Share your build, ask questions, or offer feedback in the community
- Contribute documentation, code, patterns, or test results
- Help welcome newcomers by answering questions and reviewing guides
