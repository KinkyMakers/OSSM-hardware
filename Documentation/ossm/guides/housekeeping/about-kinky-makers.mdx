## Our story

Kinky Makers was founded by Alex and James in Toronto, Canada in 2020. It began as a physical space for creators to gather and build devilish creations together.

More importantly, it gave early members a space to normalize their kinks through a shared interest in engineering and hacking. Taboo questions like "how many watts does a stepper motor need for anal penetration?" became commonplace, offering a space to educate, discuss, and feel safe.

## Our mission

This is the essence of Kinky Makers today: a nonprofit organization run by the community, giving everyone an opportunity to learn, share, and grow—both as makers and as kinksters.

## Our sponsor

Kinky Makers is sponsored by Research and Desire, a company Alex founded alongside Kinky Makers.
