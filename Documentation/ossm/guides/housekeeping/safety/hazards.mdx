<Warning>
This page summarizes known hazards for OSSM-style builds. Your specific configuration may introduce additional risks. If you change materials, dimensions, electronics, firmware, or mounting, perform your own hazard assessment before use.
</Warning>

## Before you begin: safety checklist

<Steps>
<Step title="Stage the area and controls">
- Place the stand on a flat, stable surface with all fasteners tightened.
- Route cables to avoid trip and snag points. Keep the power supply off the floor and away from liquids.
- Identify your physical emergency stop (power switch or quick-disconnect) and ensure it’s reachable without crossing moving parts.

<Check>
Confirm you can cut power in under 1 second without touching the moving carriage.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Power-on and firmware sanity checks">
- Power on the device and let it complete homing.
- Verify low-speed, short-stroke motion works as expected before any contact with the body.
- If using the Wireless Remote (RADR), pair normally and note that OSSM will ramp down and pause if the connection is lost.

<Info>
See <a href="/research-and-desire-remote/quick-start">RADR Quick Start</a> and <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/flashing-your-ossm">Flashing your OSSM</a> for pairing and firmware guidance.
</Info>

<Check>
With no load attached, start a short pattern and stop it using the emergency control. Movement should cease immediately.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Mounting and guards">
- Install pulley/bearing covers and any rail guards supplied by your design.
- Use a toy adapter with a wide base that acts as a physical stop.
- Verify stand orientation prevents fluid pooling on the PCB cover.

<Check>
With the device powered off, move the carriage by hand to the rear stop to verify a hard stop exists.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Start every session at the lowest speed and shortest stroke. Increase gradually only after verifying control and comfort.
</Tip>

## Mechanical hazards

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pinch points: body parts caught in mechanism" icon="gears">
    **Vulnerability:** Exposed pulleys, belts, and bearings create pinch points at the front and rear of the linear rail.

    **Likely consequences:** Pinching, crushing, lacerations.

    **Mitigations**
    - **Designer:** Provide covers for pulleys/bearings; ensure clearances and shielded pinch zones in the CAD; label hazard areas in documentation.
    - **Builder:** Install all provided covers and guards; verify no fasteners protrude into motion paths; deburr printed edges.
    - **User:** Keep hands, skin, clothing, and accessories away from the rail ends and belt path; adjust the device via the stand, not the moving body.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hair entanglement" icon="scissors">
    **Vulnerability:** Long hair or loose clothing can be drawn into the drive mechanism.

    **Likely consequences:** Hair loss, scalp injury, tissue trauma.

    **Mitigations**

    - **Builder:** Install all guards; ensure no gaps around moving belts and pulleys.
    - **User:** Tie back hair; avoid leaning over the device; position the mechanism below waist level when practical.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Toy mount thread or adapter failure" icon="bolt">
    **Vulnerability:** FDM parts can fail along layer lines, exposing sharp splinters or the metal rail.

    **Likely consequences:** Cuts, bleeding, internal injuries.

    **Mitigations**
    - **Designer:** Use thread forms that are supported by the rail or a metal insert; specify wall thickness, perimeters, and infill; avoid geometries that create shard-like fracture paths toward the user.
    - **Builder:** Print with sufficient wall count and infill; optimize layer height for strength; use materials with good interlayer adhesion; inspect for cracks and reprint if in doubt.
    - **User:** Mount toys per instructions; avoid excessive leverage on adapters; replace any part that shows stress whitening or cracks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Interchangeable head failure" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Vulnerability:** Printed mounting plates or quick-change interfaces can fracture along deposition lines.

    **Likely consequences:** Cuts, bleeding, internal injuries.

    **Mitigations**
    - **Designer:** Reinforce screw bosses, plates, and outer walls; chamfer or shield edges so broken pieces don’t point toward the user; document print settings and minimum material specs.
    - **Builder:** Use recommended materials; verify fit without forcing; discard parts with poor layer bonding or voids.
    - **User:** Avoid side-loading; mount and lock heads fully; stop use at the first sign of cracking or unusual sounds.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Over‑penetration hazards

<Warning>
GPIO or software-only limits are not sufficient to prevent over‑penetration in a fault. Always include physical controls such as a hard rear stop and a reachable emergency power cut.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Software fault causing over‑penetration" icon="code">
    **Vulnerability:** A firmware or control error commands excessive depth.

    **Likely consequences:** Tissue trauma or internal injury.

    **Mitigations**
    - **Designer:** Isolate depth/position logic in well-tested modules; require code review and bench testing; provide a hardware rear stop; include a clearly labeled emergency stop that removes motor power; recommend conservative rail lengths; design adapters with wide physical bases.
    - **Builder:** Use the shortest practical rail; avoid overspecifying motor torque; wire and test the emergency stop; verify the hard stop engages before the maximum stroke.
    - **User:** Maintain the ability to move away; avoid restraints; prefer shorter toys with wide bases; test the stop before each session.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Operator error causing over‑penetration" icon="user-xmark">
    **Vulnerability:** Incorrect setup, distraction, or misuse leads to excessive depth.

    **Likely consequences:** Tissue trauma or internal injury.

    **Mitigations**
    - **Designer:** Specify stand weight, base dimensions, and dynamic load limits; provide multiple securing points; publish recommended materials and print settings; supply wide‑base adapters by default.
