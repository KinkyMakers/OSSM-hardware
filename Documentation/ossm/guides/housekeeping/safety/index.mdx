description: "Understand the safety considerations and risk hierarchy when building and using your OSSM"
---

<Warning>
The OSSM is an open-source framework for building your own device. Your specific combination of parts may have risks not inherent to other builds. Some risks may be undocumented or undiscovered.
</Warning>

## Understanding Your Responsibility

The safety of the OSSM continues to be characterized as an evolving project. As a DIY build, only you can be responsible for your safety. If you are unsure about something, find a resource, ask the Discord community, or pause before proceeding.

## Safety Hierarchy

When using your OSSM, follow this hierarchy of safety controls:

1. **Maintain ability to move away** — You should always be able to physically distance yourself from the device
2. **Maintain ability to remove power** — Keep the power switch or plug accessible at all times
3. **Assign safety responsibility** — If using restraints, the Top or supervising partner assumes responsibility for all consenting adults involved

## General Safety

You should understand how your setup works before operating it. Every build differs slightly, so ensure you are comfortable with your configuration.

<Tip>
When in doubt, ask the Discord community or consult the documentation before proceeding.
</Tip>

## Electrical Safety

<Note>
24V is generally considered a safe, low voltage. However, you should always verify wiring polarity and ensure nothing conductive is near the board or power supply that could cause a short circuit.
</Note>

## Mechanical Safety

<Warning>
Pinch points exist near the rail. Keep body parts away from these areas during operation.
</Warning>

Depending on your motor selection, the OSSM can generate significant force. This force can cause injury if not applied correctly, especially in delicate areas. Always:

- Maintain the ability to move away from the machine
- Designate someone responsible for your safety when using with a partner
- Understand your risk tolerance and have a plan for potential issues

<Info>
This is an open-source, community-based project. Many contributors help develop it, which accelerates progress. This also means no single entity is responsible for the complete safety of the design. Play risk-aware and consensually.
