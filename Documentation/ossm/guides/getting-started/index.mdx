# What is the Open Source Sex Machine (OSSM)

## **Summary**   
**OSSM** (pronounced like "awesome") is a user friendly every day sex machine for the people.

The OSSM's primary feature is that it is a servo powered belt-driven linear rail.  
This allows for quiet, high torque operation at speeds up to 1 meter per second, as well as for software-defined stroke and depth. 

**Standard Recommended Build at a glance**
 - 32 lbs (14 kg) of force @ 20v DC
   - Up to 50 lbs (22 kg) @ 36v DC
 - 8" Stroke (20 cm) with 350mm rail

What does that mean for you? 

We have many users who use large knotted toys anally, without problem.

This project aims to help people curious about sex machines explore their interest.   
A second objective is optionally learning how mechanics, electronics, physics and computing are involved in your sexual pleasure.


## **Primary** Design Goals

- Compact & quiet
- Highly performant
- Moderate cost
- 3D printable
- Easily-sourced components
- Moddable
