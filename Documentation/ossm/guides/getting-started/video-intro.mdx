I've tried other sex machines before, but they would stall or not be able to handle bigger toys.

Not only can the OSSM do that, I also built it myself with custom colors. I really got to create my ultimate dream machine.

Oh, and did I mention how good this thing fucks?

*[Moaning]*

Yeah, I'm thinking about hopping back on it, just watching that.

Thank you, Research and Desire.
