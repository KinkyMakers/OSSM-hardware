---

This guide walks you through operating your fully assembled OSSM. You'll learn how to power on, navigate the menu system, and control stroke patterns.

<Note>
This guide covers the wired remote interface. If you're using a wireless remote, refer to the [Research and Desire guides](https://researchanddesire.com/guides) for wireless-specific instructions.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A fully assembled OSSM (complete all [build guide](/guides/getting-started/build-guide/step-0.0_introduction) steps)
- Either a wired remote or wireless remote connected
- A sufficient power supply (24V, 5A minimum)

## Powering on and homing

<Steps>
<Step title="Connect power">
Plug your OSSM into a sufficient power supply. The controller should power on and display the startup screen.
</Step>

<Step title="Wait for homing">
The OSSM automatically begins the homing sequence. The actuator moves slowly to find its home position.

<Warning>
If homing is too slow or stalls, see the [troubleshooting guide](/guides/getting-started/user-guide/troubleshooting#homing-is-too-slow).
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Enter the main menu">
After homing completes, the main menu appears on the wired remote display.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Main menu options

The main menu provides four operating modes:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Simple Penetration** | Basic operation with minimal controls |
| **Stroke Engine** | Advanced pattern-based control with depth, stroke, and sensation settings |
| **WiFi** | Configure wireless connectivity |
| **Restart** | Restart the controller and re-home |

## Using Stroke Engine

Stroke Engine provides the most control over your OSSM's behavior. Select it from the main menu to enter pattern-based operation.

<Info>
You may see a "speed is too high" warning when entering Stroke Engine. This safety feature activates when the speed potentiometer isn't at zero. Turn the left knob fully counterclockwise to clear the warning.
</Info>

### Display layout

The Stroke Engine interface shows:

- **Left bar** — Speed (0–100%), controlled by the left knob
- **Right bars** — Three stacked indicators for depth, stroke, and sensation
- **Center** — Currently active pattern name

### Controls

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Speed control">
Use the **left encoder** to adjust speed from 0% to 100%.

- Turn clockwise to increase speed
- Turn counterclockwise to decrease speed
</Tab>

<Tab title="Stroke settings">
The **right encoder** controls three parameters:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Depth** | How far "into" the body the actuator travels at its deepest point |
| **Stroke** | How far the actuator retracts "out" from the deepest point |
| **Sensation** | A pattern-specific modifier that changes behavior |

**To adjust settings:**
1. Press the right encoder once to cycle between depth, stroke, and sensation
2. Turn the right encoder to increase or decrease the selected value
</Tab>

<Tab title="Emergency stop">
**Hold the right encoder for 3 seconds** to perform a rapid stop. This immediately halts movement and returns you to the main menu.

<Warning>
Emergency stop may cause the OSSM to lose its homing position. You may need to restart and re-home after using this feature.
</Warning>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Changing patterns

Press the right encoder **twice quickly** to open the pattern selection menu.

**Available patterns:**

| Pattern | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Simple Stroke** | Balanced acceleration, coasting, and deceleration; sensation has no effect |
| **Teasing Pounding** | Speed shifts with sensation setting; balances faster strokes |
| **Robo Stroke** | Sensation varies acceleration from robotic to gradual |
| **Half'n'Half** | Alternates between full and half depth strokes; sensation affects speed |
| **Deeper** | Stroke depth increases each cycle; sensation sets cycle count |
| **Stop'n'Go** | Pauses between strokes; sensation adjusts pause length |
| **Insist** | Modifies stroke length while maintaining speed; sensation influences direction |

Scroll to your desired pattern and press the encoder to select it. The pattern changes immediately.
