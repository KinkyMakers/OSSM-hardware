This guide helps you diagnose and fix the most common issues with your OSSM. Start by identifying your symptom, then follow the troubleshooting steps.

## Homing is too slow

If your OSSM homes very slowly or stalls during the homing sequence, the motor may need to be programmed.

<Steps>
<Step title="Check motor programming">
The motor requires specific parameters to operate correctly with OSSM. If you assembled the motor yourself or it was reset, you may need to flash the motor firmware.

See the [motor programming guide](/ossm/Hardware/motor/programming) for detailed instructions.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify motor parameters">
After programming, the motor should home at a reasonable speed. If problems persist, double-check that all parameters were applied correctly.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Controller powers on but actuator does not move

When the controller turns on but the actuator remains stationary, the issue is typically related to power delivery, wiring, or belt tension.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Insufficient power supply">
**Symptoms:**
- Green light on motor is dim or flickering
- Motor light is visible but actuator doesn't respond
- Actuator moves weakly or stalls under load

**Solution:**
Ensure you're using a power supply that meets the minimum requirements:
- Voltage: 24V DC
- Current: At least 5A (10A recommended)

<Warning>
Using an underpowered supply can damage components over time. Always use a supply rated for your motor's requirements.
</Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Motor wiring disconnected">
**Symptoms:**
- Motor light is completely off
- No response from motor when commands are sent
- Visible loose or disconnected wires

**Diagnosis:**
1. Inspect the wiring between the controller and motor
2. Check that all connectors are fully seated
3. Look for damaged or frayed wires

**Solution:**
Reconnect any loose wiring following the [wiring guide](/ossm/guides/getting-started/build-guide/step-11.0_wiring). If wires are damaged, replace them before operating.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Belt or pulley tension too loose">
**Symptoms:**
- Motor spins but actuator doesn't move
- Belt slips or makes noise during operation
- Inconsistent or jerky movement

**Solution:**
Adjust the belt tension following the [tension adjustment guide](/ossm/guides/getting-started/build-guide/step-9.0_tension_adjustment). The belt should be tight enough to prevent slipping but not so tight that it strains the motor.

<Tip>
A properly tensioned belt should deflect slightly when pressed but return to position immediately.

## Wired remote lights up but speed control does not respond

If the wired remote display illuminates but the left knob (speed potentiometer) has no effect, the potentiometer component may be faulty.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Verify the issue">
**Symptoms:**
- Remote display turns on and shows the menu
- Right knob (encoder) works normally for menu navigation
- Left knob (speed control) produces no change regardless of position
- No visible damage to the knob or circuit board

**Diagnosis:**
1. Power on OSSM and confirm the remote display activates
2. Navigate menus with the right knob to confirm it responds
3. Turn the left knob fully counterclockwise to clockwise—if speed never changes, the potentiometer is likely defective
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Confirm it's not a connection issue">
Before concluding the potentiometer is faulty:

1. Power off and reseat the RJ45 cable at both ends until it clicks
2. Try a different RJ45 cable if available
3. Inspect the cable connectors for bent pins or debris
4. Power on and test again

If the right knob still works but the left knob doesn't respond, the issue is the potentiometer rather than the connection.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Resolution">
A non-responsive potentiometer indicates a hardware fault that cannot be fixed through software or settings. Contact support to request a replacement wired remote under warranty.

<Tip>
If you have a RADR wireless remote, you can continue using your OSSM while waiting for the replacement. The RADR provides full speed and stroke control.
