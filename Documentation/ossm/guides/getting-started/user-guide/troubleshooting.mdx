This guide helps you diagnose and fix the most common issues with your OSSM. Start by identifying your symptom, then follow the troubleshooting steps.

## Homing is too slow

If your OSSM homes very slowly or stalls during the homing sequence, the motor may need to be programmed.

<Steps>
<Step title="Check motor programming">
The motor requires specific parameters to operate correctly with OSSM. If you assembled the motor yourself or it was reset, you may need to flash the motor firmware.

See the [motor programming guide](/ossm/Hardware/motor/programming) for detailed instructions.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify motor parameters">
After programming, the motor should home at a reasonable speed. If problems persist, double-check that all parameters were applied correctly.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Controller powers on but actuator does not move

When the controller turns on but the actuator remains stationary, the issue is typically related to power delivery, wiring, or belt tension.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Insufficient power supply">
**Symptoms:**
- Green light on motor is dim or flickering
- Motor light is visible but actuator doesn't respond
- Actuator moves weakly or stalls under load

**Solution:**
Ensure you're using a power supply that meets the minimum requirements:
- Voltage: 24V DC
- Current: At least 5A (10A recommended)

<Warning>
Using an underpowered supply can damage components over time. Always use a supply rated for your motor's requirements.
</Warning>

<Accordion title="Motor wiring disconnected">
**Symptoms:**
- Motor light is completely off
- No response from motor when commands are sent
- Visible loose or disconnected wires

**Diagnosis:**
1. Inspect the wiring between the controller and motor
2. Check that all connectors are fully seated
3. Look for damaged or frayed wires

**Solution:**
Reconnect any loose wiring following the [wiring guide](/ossm/guides/getting-started/build-guide/step-11.0_wiring). If wires are damaged, replace them before operating.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Belt or pulley tension too loose">
**Symptoms:**
- Motor spins but actuator doesn't move
- Belt slips or makes noise during operation
- Inconsistent or jerky movement

**Solution:**
Adjust the belt tension following the [tension adjustment guide](/ossm/guides/getting-started/build-guide/step-9.0_tension_adjustment). The belt should be tight enough to prevent slipping but not so tight that it strains the motor.

<Tip>
A properly tensioned belt should deflect slightly when pressed but return to position immediately.
