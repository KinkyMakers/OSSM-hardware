description: "Complete technical specifications for the OSSM Ready to Play, including power requirements, performance metrics, and modification options."

## Overview
These specifications help you plan power, performance, and mechanical modifications for OSSM Ready to Play. Values represent typical performance of a stock unit under normal operating conditions.

<Info>
Unless otherwise noted, measurements reflect operation with a dedicated 24 V DC, 4 A power supply. Actual performance can vary with payload, friction, alignment, and firmware settings.
</Info>

## Electrical

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Operating voltage | 24 V DC |
| Current draw | 4 A max |
| Idle power | 1–5 W |
| Average power | 30 W |
| Peak power | 95 W |

<Warning>
Use a quality 24 V DC power supply rated for at least 4 A to achieve peak performance. Undersized or unstable supplies can cause stalls, reduced force, or controller resets.
</Warning>

## Performance

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Maximum linear speed | 1 m/s (3.3 ft/s) |
| Maximum pushing force (24 V supply) | 45 lbs (20 kg) |
| Maximum pushing force (USB‑C adapter) | 35 lbs (16 kg) |
| Maximum toy weight | 2.5 lbs (1.1 kg) |

<Note>
A USB‑C power adapter delivers reduced pushing force compared to a dedicated 24 V supply. For applications requiring maximum force, use the full 24 V @ 4 A power supply.
</Note>

## Dimensions

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Collapsed (storage) | 22 × 11.5 × 7.5 in (56 × 29 × 19 cm) |
| Upright (in use) | 22 × 11.5 × 23 in (56 × 29 × 58 cm) |
| Stroke length | 7 in (180 mm) |
| Rail length | 14 in (350 mm) |

## Shipping

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Shipping box dimensions | 24 × 12 × 12 in (61 × 30 × 30 cm) |

The Ready-to-Play ships in a plain, unmarked cardboard box with no branding. For more information about our privacy practices, see [Discreet Shipping](/shop/faqs/discreet-shipping).

## Storage and Portability

The Ready-to-Play stand folds flat for compact storage—slide it under a bed or into a closet. The unit does not disassemble, but the collapsible design makes it easy to store when not in use.

## Noise

OSSM uses a nearly silent belt drive system. At low to moderate speeds, the machine operates very quietly. Noise increases at higher speeds but remains reasonable for most environments.

## Modifications
You can extend the rail length beyond the default configuration to increase stroke length.

| Modification | Limit |
|--------------|-------|
| Maximum recommended rail length | 18 in (450 mm) |
| Maximum stroke length | Rail length − 7 in (180 mm) |

<Tip>
Calculate your maximum stroke by subtracting 7 in (180 mm) from your total rail length. For example, an 18 in rail supports a maximum stroke of 11 in.
</Tip>

<Note>
Extending rail length increases the potential stroke but may also increase bending and friction if not properly supported. Ensure rails are aligned and supported to maintain smooth motion and reduce wear.
</Note>

### Upgrading your rail later

If you purchase a Ready to Play with the standard 350mm rail and decide you want more stroke length later, you can upgrade. The rail is designed to be user-replaceable—your R2P includes spare fasteners and Allen keys to support modifications.

To order a longer rail:

1. Contact [support@researchanddesire.com](mailto:support@researchanddesire.com) with your upgrade request
2. Specify your preferred rail length (400mm or 500mm are standard stock sizes; other lengths may require additional lead time)
3. Support will provide pricing and shipping details

<Tip>
Rail replacement is straightforward and doesn't require specialized tools beyond the Allen keys included with your kit. If you're unsure about the process, reach out to support or ask in the Kinky Makers Discord.
</Tip>

## Custom Order Options

When ordering your Ready to Play unit, you can request the following customizations:

| Upgrade | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Extended rail | Longer rail for increased stroke length (up to 500mm) |
| Wider belt | 15mm belt for increased durability and power transfer |
| Motor upgrade | Higher-torque motor options for demanding applications |
| Motor color | Black motor instead of the standard gold finish |
| Custom 3D printed part colors | Choose a custom color (e.g., pink, purple, red) for all 3D printed components |

<Tip>
For users planning to use larger or heavier toys (such as large silicone toys for anal use), we recommend requesting the wider belt and potentially a motor upgrade. These modifications help ensure consistent performance under higher loads.
</Tip>

### How to Request a Custom Build

To request a custom configuration:

1. Fill out the [custom order request form](https://researchanddesire.com/pages/custom-order-request)
2. Specify your requirements (rail length, belt width, motor preference, remote type, custom colors)
3. We'll respond with availability, pricing, and ordering instructions

<Info>
Custom orders have longer lead times than standard configurations—typically 4–5 weeks. Contact us before placing your order to confirm availability and pricing.
</Info>

<Check>
You’ve confirmed: your power supply is 24 V ≥ 4 A, your expected load is ≤ 2.5 lbs (1.1 kg), and your planned rail length and stroke respect the limits above.
</Check>
