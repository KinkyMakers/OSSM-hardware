## Electrical

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Operating voltage | 24V DC |
| Current draw | 4A max |
| Idle power | 1–5W |
| Average power | 30W |
| Peak power | 95W |

## Performance

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Maximum linear speed | 1 m/s (3.3 ft/s) |
| Maximum pushing force (24V supply) | 45 lbs (20 kg) |
| Maximum pushing force (USB-C adapter) | 35 lbs (16 kg) |
| Maximum toy weight | 2.5 lbs (1.1 kg) |

<Note>
The USB-C power adapter provides reduced pushing force compared to a dedicated 24V power supply. For applications requiring maximum force, use the full 24V @ 4A power supply.
</Note>

## Dimensions

| Specification | Default Value |
|---------------|---------------|
| Stroke length | 7 in (180 mm) |
| Rail length | 14 in (350 mm) |

## Modifications

You can extend the rail length beyond the default configuration for increased stroke length.

| Modification | Limit |
|--------------|-------|
| Maximum recommended rail length | 18 in (450 mm) |
| Maximum stroke length | Rail length − 7 in (180 mm) |

<Tip>
To calculate your maximum stroke length, subtract 180 mm (7 in) from your total rail length. For example, an 18-inch rail supports a maximum stroke of 11 inches.
