Welcome to your OSSM Ready-to-Play kit. This guide helps you unbox, set up, and use your machine safely and confidently.

## What’s in the box

Your accessory box includes:

- OSSM remote and Ethernet cable (or wireless remote, depending on configuration)
- Spare fasteners and Allen keys
- End-effector set with 3 ft paracord for attaching toys
- Empty sandbag (counterweight)
- 24V power supply

<Note>
Contents may vary slightly based on your order options. If something is missing, <a href="mailto:support@researchanddesire.com">reach out</a>.
</Note>

## Before you begin

- Choose a stable, flat surface with enough clearance for full stroke length.
- Have clean, playbox-quality sand ready for the counterweight.
- If you have the wireless remote (RADR), charge it via USB‑C before pairing. See <a href="/research-and-desire-remote/quick-start">RADR Quick Start</a>.

<Tip>
Keep your firmware current for best performance. See <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/flashing-your-ossm">Flashing your OSSM</a>.
</Tip>

## First-time setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Review the assembly overview">
Scan the QR code included with your kit for the step-by-step assembly walkthrough.
</Step>

<Step title="Fill and place the sandbag counterweight">
Fill both compartments of the included sandbag with clean, playbox-quality sand and seal fully. Place it so it counterbalances the OSSM and stand during operation.

<Warning>
Do not use beach sand. It may contain salt, moisture, and microbes that can cause contamination or corrosion.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect power and controls">
- Mount and secure the machine to your stand or base.
- Plug the 24V power supply into the board’s barrel jack.
- If using the wired remote, connect the Ethernet cable firmly at both ends.
- If using the wireless remote (RADR), power it on and follow the <a href="/research-and-desire-remote/quick-start">RADR Quick Start</a>.
</Step>

<Step title="Home and test motion (no load)">
Power on the OSSM and allow it to complete its homing routine. Keep hands and loose items away from the rail and carriage.

<Check>
Confirm the carriage moves smoothly across its range without unusual sounds, binding, or stalls.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Attach a toy securely">
Use the end-effector hardware and paracord to secure your toy. Verify all knots, clamps, and fasteners are tight and cannot slip under load.

<Check>
Gently tug-test the attachment before play. Recheck after the first minute of motion.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Start slow and dial in settings">
Begin at low speed and short stroke. Gradually increase as you confirm stability and comfort.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Safety guidelines

### General safety

<Note>
You are responsible for your setup and safety. If anything is unclear, pause and seek help in the community or <a href="mailto:support@researchanddesire.com">contact support</a>.
</Note>

- Understand how your specific configuration works before play.
- Keep the area tidy and free of cables or objects that could snag.
- Establish a clear stop or safe word/gesture with any partner.

### Electrical safety

- The OSSM operates at 24V. Verify wiring polarity before powering on.
- Keep conductive materials away from the board and power supply.
- Ensure all connectors are fully seated; never insert or remove cables under load.

<Tip>
Use a high‑quality, UL‑listed 24V supply and check for firm barrel‑jack connection at the board. See the <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/ossm-electronics/ossm-pcb-spec-sheet">PCB Spec Sheet</a>.
</Tip>

### Mechanical safety

<Warning>
The rail and carriage include pinch points. Keep fingers, hair, clothing, and sensitive areas clear during operation.
</Warning>

- Depending on motor selection, the OSSM can generate significant force. Increase intensity gradually and avoid sudden changes.
- Always maintain the ability to move away from the machine quickly. If playing with a partner, designate a spotter responsible for safety.
- Inspect fasteners, belts, and mounts regularly—tighten as needed.

<Info>
Using the wireless remote (RADR)? If Bluetooth disconnects during play, the OSSM will ramp down and pause as a safety precaution. For pairing and recovery tips, see <a href="/research-and-desire-remote/quick-start">RADR Quick Start</a>.
</Info>

## Sandbag setup (counterweight)

- Fill both sides with clean, playbox-quality sand.
- Seal completely and place to counterbalance your stand and machine.
- Re-check placement anytime you change height, angle, or stroke length.

<Warning>
Avoid beach sand due to potential contaminants and moisture.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting basics

- No motion after power-on: verify 24V supply, barrel jack connection, and that the board is powered. Allow homing to complete before sending motion.
- Jerky or unexpected motion: recheck motor and remote connections; reduce speed/stroke and test again.
- Remote won’t connect:
  - Wired: reseat Ethernet connectors until they click.
  - Wireless (RADR): charge the remote, power-cycle both devices, and retry pairing using the <a href="/research-and-desire-remote/quick-start">RADR Quick Start</a>.
- Firmware mismatch or issues: update using <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/flashing-your-ossm">Flashing your OSSM</a>.

## Community project disclaimer

<Info>
OSSM is an open‑source, community‑driven project. Many contributors help it evolve rapidly, but no single entity can guarantee complete safety of every configuration.
