### Sandbag setup

The included sandbag acts as a counterweight to stabilize your OSSM during use. Fill both sides with playbox-quality sand.

<Warning>
Avoid using beach sand—it may contain microbes that could cause contamination.
</Warning>

## Safety guidelines

### General safety

<Note>
While we've designed the OSSM to be approachable, you are ultimately responsible for your own safety. If you're ever unsure about something, pause and find a resource. Ask on Discord or take time to understand your setup before proceeding.
</Note>

This is a DIY project, and every build is slightly different. Make sure you understand how your specific setup works before use.

### Electrical safety

The OSSM operates at 24V, which is generally considered a safe low voltage. However, you should still exercise caution:

- Always verify wiring polarity before powering on
- Keep conductive materials away from the board and power supply
- Ensure nothing could cause a short circuit

### Mechanical safety

<Warning>
The OSSM has pinch points near the rail. Keep fingers and other sensitive areas clear during operation.
</Warning>

Depending on your motor selection, the OSSM can generate significant force. This force can cause injury if misapplied, especially in delicate areas.

**Best practices:**

- Always maintain the ability to move away from the machine quickly
- If using with a partner, designate someone specifically responsible for safety monitoring
- Understand your personal risk tolerance and plan accordingly
- Consider what you would do if something goes wrong

## Community project disclaimer

<Info>
The OSSM is an open-source, community-driven project. Many contributors help make it successful, which enables rapid development and innovation. However, this also means no single entity is responsible for the complete safety of the design.

Play risk-aware and consensually.

Oh—and keep it OSSM 😉
