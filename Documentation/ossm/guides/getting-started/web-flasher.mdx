---

Update or reinstall firmware for OSSM and RADR directly in your browser—no separate download or installer required.

<Info>
Before you begin, use a data-capable USB cable, charge or power your device, and close any apps that might use serial ports (Arduino IDE, serial terminals, 3D printer hosts, etc.).
</Info>

## Flash your device

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Web Flasher">
  Open the Web Flasher in your browser: 
  <a href="https://dashboard.researchanddesire.com/app/tools/web-flasher">Open Web Flasher</a>

  <Note>
  The Web Flasher requires a browser with Web Serial API support. Use the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, or Safari.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect your device">
  Plug your OSSM or RADR into your computer with a USB cable. When prompted, select your device’s serial port (often shown as “CP210x USB to UART Bridge”).

  <Check>
  The Web Flasher shows your selected port and enables the Connect/Flash controls.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Choose firmware and flash">
  Select your device (OSSM or RADR) and the firmware version shown in the flasher, then click <strong>Flash</strong>.

  <Tip>
  If you’re unsure which version to use, choose the latest stable release presented in the flasher.
  </Tip>

  <Check>
  After flashing completes, your device restarts automatically with the new firmware.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Verify the update

- Reconnect the device in the Web Flasher to confirm it is detected without errors.
- For OSSM, wait for the homing routine to complete after reboot.
- For RADR, continue with pairing and controls in the Quick Start guide: <a href="/research-and-desire-remote/quick-start">RADR Quick Start</a>.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Device not detected">
If your computer doesn’t recognize the device, you may need a USB-to-UART driver (especially on Windows). Also try:

- Use a different USB port or a known data-capable cable
- Disconnect and reconnect the device, then refresh the Web Flasher page
- Close other apps that might hold the serial port (Arduino IDE, serial consoles)

<Tab title="Windows">
Download and install the CP210x drivers from Silicon Labs:

</Tab>

<Tab title="macOS / Linux">
Most systems include drivers out of the box. If needed, get the latest VCP drivers here:

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Browser not supported or no serial prompt">
- Use the latest Chrome, Edge, or Safari
- If you previously blocked serial permissions, click your browser’s site permissions (lock icon) and allow serial ports, then reload
- Firefox does not currently support the Web Serial API—switch to a supported browser
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Flashing fails or gets stuck">
- Unplug the device, wait 10 seconds, and reconnect
- Try a different USB port/cable and refresh the flasher page
- Restart your browser or computer and try again
- Ensure no other app is using the serial port
