title: "2. End Effector"
description: "Install the end effector on the linear rail to secure the slide and complete the rail assembly"
---

The end effector is the threaded end piece that mounts to the linear rail, providing a secure attachment point for accessories and preventing the slide from coming off the rail during operation.

## Required Components and Tools

### Components

| Component | Count | Specification / Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| End Effector | 1 | The threaded end piece for the rail |
| M3 8 mm Bolts | 2 | Used to secure the end effector to the rail |
| Nuts (for M3 8mm bolts) | 2 | For the M3 8 mm bolts |
| Rubber End Stop | 1 | To be removed from the linear rail |

### Tools

| Tool | Count | Specification / Notes |
|------|-------|----------------------|
| 2.5 mm Hex | 1 | To fit the M3 bolt |
| Small Flathead Screwdriver | 1 | Or equivalent tool to help hold nuts in place |

<Info>
The end effector installation should be performed after the rear tensioner is installed. This completes the basic linear rail assembly before moving on to other components.

## Step-by-Step Assembly

<Steps>
<Step title="Remove the end stop">
Remove the remaining small rubber end stop from the linear rail and set it aside.

<Check>
The linear rail should now have both end stops removed, with the rear tensioner on one end and ready for the end effector on the opposite end.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Align the end effector">
Align the end effector's indentations with the indentations on the linear rail until the screw holes line up.

<Tip>
The indentations on both the end effector and rail help ensure proper alignment. Take a moment to verify that the holes are perfectly aligned before inserting the bolts.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Secure the end effector">
Insert the two M3 8 mm bolts through the holes from one side of the end effector.

Place a corresponding M3 nut on each bolt on the opposite side.

Flip the assembly, hold the nuts in place with the small flathead screwdriver or equivalent tool, and tighten the bolts with the 2.5 mm hex tool.

<Warning>
The bolts do not need to be excessively tight, just snug enough to hold the end effector securely to the rail. Overtightening could damage the components or strip the threads.
</Warning>

<Check>
The end effector should be securely mounted to the rail with both bolts tightened. The rail is now safe from the slide coming off during operation.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

With the end effector installed, the linear rail assembly is complete. Proceed to install the front tensioner to set the hard limit for the stroke.
