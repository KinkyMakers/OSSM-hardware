Hey! This is AJ from Research And Desire. Welcome to the community build guide of the OSSM. I'm going to show you step by step how to go from the DIY kit to a fully assembled functioning OSSM.

Before we begin, I'd like to introduce you to the parts of the OSSM so that you know what we're talking about.

## OSSM Overview

The OSSM is composed of two major groups: the actuator and the frame.

### Actuator

The actuator is the functional core of the device and includes everything from the pit clamp, the motor, the linear rail, the tensioner, and the end effector.

<Info>
  Most of your build time today will be focused on assembling the actuator.

### Frame

The frame is the structural part, specifically the aluminum body that holds and supports the actuator.

## Building the Actuator

The actuator is the functional core of the OSSM, and it's the first thing that we should build.

Here are the steps that we're going to follow today:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Rear Tensioner">
    Installed, including initial belt threading
  </Step>
  <Step title="End Effector">
    The threaded end piece is installed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Front Tensioner">
    Installed loosely to set the stroke hard limit
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bearings and OSSM Motorhead Bottom">
    Assembly and attachment to the Linear Rail
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pulley on Motor">
    The pulley is placed and secured onto the Motor shaft
  </Step>
  <Step title="OSSM Motorhead Middle">
    The middle section is attached
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cover (Motor Head)">
    The final cover for the motor head assembly is attached
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tension Adjustment">
    The final tightening of the tension bolt to set the belt tension
  </Step>
  <Step title="Electronics Assembly">
    The OSSM Control Board is mounted and covered
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wiring">
    Connecting the voltage and four-pin data cables
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initial Test">
    Connecting the remote and power source to perform homing and a test
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Once you're familiar with the OSSM components and the build process overview, proceed to the next section to gather your required tools and parts before beginning assembly.

-- TODO 2: integrate this:

#### Threadlocker

Recommend you use some form of threadlocker/Loctite on the fasteners going into metal (nuts of bearing) to prevent them from loosening as the ossm gets shaken around quite a bit.

If you do not have Loctite, some plain white glue does a decent job, just a small amount on the ends of the threads is all you need.

You can also put threadlocker on the motor shaft to help keep the pulley tightly in place – just be sure you are happy with it’s position, this can be very hard to remove!
