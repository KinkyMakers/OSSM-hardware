Before you begin assembly, gather all required tools and parts. Having everything ready before you start will make the build process smoother and more efficient.

## Required Tools

You need the following tools to complete the OSSM actuator assembly:

| Tool | Count | Specification / Note |
|------|-------|----------------------|
| 2 mm Hex | 1 | Fits a 2.5 mm grub screw |
| 2.5 mm Hex | 1 | Fits an M3 bolt |
| 4 mm Hex | 1 | Fits an M5 bolt |
| Small Flathead Screwdriver | 1 | Used for the wiring terminals |
| Allen Wrenches (Regular) | 1 Set | Alternative to a driver tool |
| Small Screwdriver Tool | 1 | Used to speed up the assembly process |

<Tip>
A hex driver tool set can replace individual hex wrenches and speed up assembly. If you're using individual wrenches, consider having multiple sizes available to avoid switching tools frequently.
</Tip>

<Info>
All printed parts should be manufactured according to the CAD specifications. Ensure that all parts are properly printed and free of defects before beginning assembly.
</Info>

<Warning>
Double-check that you have all fasteners before starting assembly. Missing a single bolt or nut can halt your progress and require disassembly if discovered later in the process.
</Warning>
