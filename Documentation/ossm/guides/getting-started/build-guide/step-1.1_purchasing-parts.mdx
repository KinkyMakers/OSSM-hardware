## Bill of materials (purchased components)

Use this checklist to buy all non-printed parts for the official OSSM home-assembly configuration. Printed parts, linear rail, and extrusion mounts are covered separately in the mounting guides.

<Note>
  For variations (different mounts, hardware layouts, or rail lengths), see <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/ossm-mounting">OSSM Mounting</a>

  . If you’re buying our bundles, see the <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/purchase-guide-for-the-ossm-home-assembly-kit">Purchase Guide for the OSSM Home Assembly Kit</a>

  .

### Motor

<Frame caption="NEMA 23 integrated servo (Gold Motor 57AIM30 class)">
  ![NEMA 23 integrated servo motor with wiring connector](/ossm/images/_images/legacy_instructions/legacy_assembly_instructions_IHS57-30-18.jpg)
</Frame>

**Recommended: NEMA 23 integrated servo (57AIM30 class)**

- Standard build: 100W motor (recommended for most users)
- Higher power options: 140W or 180W motors increase available force; ensure your mount and fasteners are robust if you choose these.

<Tip>
  If you purchase the motor from R+D, you’ll receive the correct cables and connectors. See <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/ossm-electronics/wiring-your-gold-motor">Wiring Your Gold Motor</a>

   for step-by-step wiring.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Use only motors known to be compatible with the OSSM firmware and PCB. Third‑party clones may appear similar but can cause wiring or firmware incompatibilities.
</Warning>

<Note>
  If you source your motor from a third party (not R+D), you will need to program it before first use. See <a href="/ossm/Hardware/motor/programming">Programming Your Motor</a>

   for instructions.
</Note>

### Electronics

  ![OSSM controller PCB and remote](/ossm/images/_images/legacy_instructions/legacy_assembly_instructions_ossm_pcb_and_remote.jpg)
</Frame>

**OSSM PCB + Remote**

- OSSM control board (24V system)
- Remote: wired hand controller or the RADR wireless remote

<Info>
  Board specs: 24V input up to ~5A, step/dir outputs and PH‑4 connector, on‑board back‑EMF protection. See <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/ossm-electronics/ossm-pcb-spec-sheet">OSSM PCB Spec sheet</a>

   for details and limits.
</Info>

<Tip>
  After assembly, update firmware using the <a href="/ossm/tools/web-flasher">Web Flasher</a>

  . See <a href="/ossm/guides/getting-started/web-flasher">Flashing your OSSM</a>

   for a step-by-step guide. For RADR setup, see <a href="/research-and-desire-remote/quick-start">Wireless Remote – Quick Start</a>

### Mechanical components

  ![GT2 timing pulley, 20 teeth, 8 mm bore](/ossm/images/_images/legacy_instructions/legacy_assembly_instructions_gt2_pulley.jpg)
</Frame>

**GT2 pulley — 20T, 8 mm bore, 10 mm belt width**

<Frame caption="GT2 timing belt, 10 mm width">
  ![Coiled GT2 timing belt](/ossm/images/_images/legacy_instructions/legacy_assembly_instructions_gt2_timing_belt.png)
</Frame>

**GT2 timing belt — 10 mm width × 500 mm length (minimum)**

<Tip>
  Buy extra belt (1–2 m). It’s inexpensive and gives room for tuning stroke length or future mods.
</Tip>

<Frame caption="MR115 roller bearings (5×11×4 mm)">
  ![MR115 miniature roller bearings, 5x11x4 mm](/ossm/images/_images/legacy_instructions/legacy_assembly_instructions_roller_bearings.jpg)
</Frame>

**MR115 bearings — 5 × 11 × 4 mm (Qty: 6)**

<Tip>
  Grab a couple of spares if you can; small bearings are easy to misplace during assembly.
</Tip>

### Power supply

<Frame caption="24V 5A enclosed switching power supply">
  ![24V 5A enclosed power supply](/ossm/images/_images/legacy_instructions/legacy_assembly_instructions_24v_fully_enclosed_power_supply.jpg)
</Frame>

**24V 5A fully enclosed power supply**

- Input: AC mains appropriate for your region
- Output: 24V DC, continuous 5A

<Warning>
  Use a safety‑certified supply (UL/ETL in the U.S., CE or local equivalent). Cheap, unlabeled supplies can sag under load and may damage the board or motor.
</Warning>

<Info>
  The PCB is designed for a 24V input and can deliver up to ~6A to the motor. See the <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/ossm-electronics/ossm-pcb-spec-sheet">OSSM PCB Spec sheet</a>

   for exact limits.
</Info>

### Hardware

<Frame caption="Metric cap screw assortment">
  ![Assorted metric cap head screws in organizer](/ossm/images/_images/legacy_instructions/legacy_assembly_instructions_metric_cap_screw_kit.png)
</Frame>

**Metric cap screw kit** (typical cost ≈ \$20 USD)

You’ll use M3, M4, and M5 fasteners in several lengths during assembly.

- Common M5 lengths: 20 mm and 25 mm
- Pivot mount: 4 × M5 × 35 mm

  Include matching nuts and flat washers; nylon‑insert lock nuts are helpful for high‑vibration joints

<Tip>
  Sort fasteners by length before starting and keep a few extras on hand. A drop of medium threadlocker on high‑vibration joints prevents loosening.
</Tip>

## Quick pre‑purchase checklist

- NEMA 23 integrated servo, 100W (or 140W/180W if needed)
- OSSM PCB and remote (wired or RADR wireless)
- GT2 pulley, 20T, 8 mm bore, 10 mm belt width
- GT2 belt, 10 mm width, ≥ 500 mm length
- MR115 bearings, 5 × 11 × 4 mm — Qty: 6
- 24V 5A enclosed power supply (UL/ETL/CE certified)
- Metric cap screw kit (M3/M4/M5) plus washers and nuts
