title: "7. Cover (Motor Head)"
description: "Install the motor head cover to complete the motor assembly"
---

The motor head cover encloses and protects the motor and pulley. In this step, you align the cover and secure it with four M3×8 mm bolts—two on the top and two on the bottom.

## Required components and tools

### Components

- Cover (Motor Head) × 1 — Final enclosure for the motor head
- M3 × 8 mm bolts × 4 — Two for the top, two for the bottom

### Tools

- 2.5 mm hex key × 1 — Fits the M3 bolts
- Small flat-blade screwdriver or alignment pick × 1 — Helpful for aligning holes

<Info>
Prerequisite: The motor head assembly should already have the motor, pulley, and middle section installed from previous steps.
</Info>

<Tip>
Threadlocker is optional. If you choose to use it, apply a tiny amount of medium-strength threadlocker only to metal-to-metal fasteners. Do not use threadlocker on plastic parts.
</Tip>

## Step-by-step assembly

<Steps>
<Step title="Position the cover">
Place the motor head cover onto the assembly, keeping its top edge level with the top of the motor head.

The cover should sit flush against the middle section with all four mounting holes roughly aligned.

<Check>
The cover sits level and flush with the middle section. All four mounting holes are visible and accessible.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Install and lightly snug the top bolts">
Insert two M3 × 8 mm bolts into the top holes. Start each bolt by hand to avoid cross‑threading, then tighten gently until snug—do not fully torque yet.

<Warning>
Overtightening can damage inserts or cause a captive nut to spin. Tighten only until the bolt seats and the cover is held in place.
</Warning>

<Check>
Both top bolts are started cleanly (no cross‑threading) and lightly snug, holding the cover in position.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Fine‑tune alignment (if needed)">
If any hole is slightly off, use a small screwdriver or pick through the hole to nudge the cover or internal part into alignment before tightening.

<Tip>
If alignment remains difficult, confirm the middle section is fully seated and that no wiring, belt, or pulley feature interferes with the cover.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Install the bottom bolts">
Insert the remaining two M3 × 8 mm bolts into the bottom holes. These holes are angled—let gravity help the bolts find the threaded inserts/captive nuts. Start the threads by hand, then tighten until snug to match the top bolts.

<Info>
The angled bottom holes are designed to streamline installation. If a bolt doesn’t catch easily, back it out, realign, and try again—don’t force it.
</Info>

<Check>
All four bolts (two top, two bottom) are installed and evenly snug. The cover is uniformly seated with no gaps.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Final seating check">
Gently press around the cover perimeter to confirm it’s fully seated, then give each bolt a final, even snug so the load is shared.

<Check>
The cover does not shift when pressed, and there is no rubbing contact with the pulley or belt when the assembly is moved by hand.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="A bolt won’t start (cross‑thread risk)">
- Stop and back the bolt out immediately.
- Re‑align the cover using a small screwdriver/pick through the hole.
- Start the bolt by hand for the first few turns before using the hex key.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Captive nut or insert spins while tightening">
- Do not continue tightening—this can damage the part.
- Back the bolt out, realign, and tighten more gently.
- If the insert continues to spin, remove the cover and inspect the insert or nut before proceeding.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Visible gap between cover and middle section">
- Loosen all bolts 1–2 turns.
- Press the cover fully into place.
- Re‑snug bolts in an alternating pattern (top‑left, bottom‑right, top‑right, bottom‑left).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rubbing or interference after installation">
- Loosen bolts slightly and re‑center the cover.
- Verify no wires or belt are pinched.
- Re‑snug evenly and recheck.

## Next steps

With the motor head cover installed, the motor assembly is complete. Proceed to adjust the belt tension before first power‑on to ensure smooth, reliable OSSM operation.
