The motor head cover provides the final protective enclosure for the motor assembly. This step involves positioning the cover and securing it with four M3 bolts—two on the top and two on the bottom.

## Required Components and Tools

### Components

| Component | Count | Specification / Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Cover (Motor Head) | 1 | Final cover for the motor head assembly |
| M3 8 mm Bolts | 4 | Two for the top, two for the bottom |

### Tools

| Tool | Count | Specification / Notes |
|------|-------|----------------------|
| 2.5 mm Hex | 1 | To fit the M3 bolts |
| Small Screwdriver Tool | 1 | For aligning holes if necessary (or equivalent) |

<Info>
The motor head assembly should already have the motor, pulley, and middle section installed from previous steps.

## Step-by-Step Assembly

<Steps>
<Step title="Position the cover">
Place the motor head cover onto the assembly, ensuring it is level with the top.

The cover should sit flush against the motor head middle section with all mounting holes properly aligned.

<Check>
The cover sits level and aligns with the motor head assembly. All four mounting holes should be visible and accessible.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Secure the top bolts">
Insert two of the M3 8 mm bolts into the top screw holes. Tighten them gently until they are snug.

<Warning>
Do not overtighten the bolts, as this can cause the internal nut to spin and make removal difficult later. Tighten only until the bolts are snug and secure.
</Warning>

<Check>
Both top bolts are securely fastened but not overtightened. The cover should be held firmly in place at the top.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Check alignment (if needed)">
If the holes do not align easily, use a small screwdriver or tool to gently push the assembly or part into place before tightening the bolts.

<Tip>
If alignment is difficult, check that the motor head middle section is properly seated and that no components are interfering with the cover placement.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Secure the bottom bolts">
Insert the remaining two M3 8 mm bolts into the bottom holes. These holes are angled, and the bolts should fall into place with the help of gravity.

Tighten these bolts until they are snug, matching the tightness of the top bolts.

<Info>
The angled bottom holes are designed to make installation easier. The bolts should naturally align as you insert them.
</Info>

<Check>
All four bolts (two top, two bottom) are securely fastened. The cover should be evenly secured around the entire motor head assembly with no gaps or misalignment.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

With the motor head cover installed, the motor assembly is now complete. Proceed to the next section to adjust the belt tension, which is critical for proper OSSM operation.
