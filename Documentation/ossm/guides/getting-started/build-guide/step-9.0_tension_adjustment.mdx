title: "8. Tension Adjustment"
description: "Final belt tension adjustment to ensure proper alignment and optimal performance of the OSSM actuator"
---

After all actuator components are assembled, you need to perform the final belt tension adjustment. This step ensures the belt is properly tensioned, aligned, and in contact with all required components for optimal performance.

## Required Components and Tools

### Components

| Component | Count | Specification / Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Adjustment Bolt | 1 | M5 bolt already installed in the Rear Tensioner |

### Tools

| Tool | Count | Specification / Notes |
|------|-------|----------------------|
| Your Hand/Grip | 1 | Used to tighten the adjustment bolt |

<Info>
The adjustment bolt (M5 bolt) should already be installed in the rear tensioner from earlier assembly steps. This final adjustment uses hand-tightening force to set the proper belt tension.
</Info>

## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the adjustment bolt">
Locate the M5 adjustment bolt that is protruding from the rear tensioner piece.

<Check>
You should see the M5 bolt extending from the rear tensioner, ready for final adjustment.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Hand tighten the bolt">
Tighten the adjustment bolt using your hand/grip as much as you comfortably can. Apply firm, steady pressure by gripping and twisting the bolt.

<Tip>
The force applied by hand-gripping and twisting is the target initial tension. You don't need to use tools or excessive force—hand-tightening provides the appropriate tension level for optimal belt performance.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Do not use tools or excessive force to tighten the bolt beyond what you can comfortably achieve by hand. Over-tightening can damage components or create excessive wear on the belt and bearings.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify alignment and contact">
Move the linear rail slide (the assembly) back and forth along its full range of motion to ensure all components are properly aligned.

<Check>
The slide should move smoothly along the rail without binding or excessive resistance. All components should remain properly aligned throughout the full range of motion.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Check belt contact with bearings">
Confirm that the belt is in contact with all three bearings on both sides of the motor head. The belt should maintain contact with all six bearings (three on each side) throughout the entire range of motion.

<Check>
Visually inspect both sides of the motor head to verify the belt contacts all three bearings on each side. The belt should not skip or lose contact with any bearing during movement.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Check pulley alignment">
Confirm that the belt is centered on the pulley. The belt should ride evenly on the pulley without drifting to one side or the other.

<Tip>
If the belt is not centered on the pulley, you may need to adjust the pulley position or check that the motor head components are properly aligned. The belt should track straight along the pulley's center groove.
</Tip>

<Check>
The belt should be centered on the pulley and remain centered throughout the full range of motion. There should be no visible drift or misalignment.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Verification Checklist

After completing the tension adjustment, verify the following:

- [ ] The adjustment bolt is hand-tightened to a comfortable level
- [ ] The linear rail slide moves smoothly without binding
- [ ] The belt maintains contact with all three bearings on both sides of the motor head
- [ ] The belt is centered on the pulley
- [ ] All components remain properly aligned throughout the full range of motion

<Info>
If any of these checks fail, you may need to adjust the tension bolt slightly or verify that all components are properly assembled. The belt tension should be sufficient to maintain contact with all bearings while still allowing smooth movement.
</Info>

## Next Steps

With the belt properly tensioned and all components verified, proceed to the electronics assembly to mount the OSSM Control Board and complete the actuator assembly.
