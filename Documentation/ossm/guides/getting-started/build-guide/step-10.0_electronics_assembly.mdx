The electronics assembly involves mounting the OSSM Control Board to its frame mount and securing the protective cover. This step protects the control board and prepares it for wiring in the next section.

## Required Components and Tools

### Components

| Component                 | Count | Specification / Notes                      |
| ------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| OSSM Control Board        | 1     | The electronics PCB                        |
| PCB Enclosure             | 1     | The mount for the control board            |
| M3 Bolts (Board Mount)    | 2     | Typically 8mm to 15mm length               |
| Cover (Electronics Board) | 1     | Protective cover for the electronics board |
| M3 Bolts (Elec. Cover)    | 4     | Typically 8mm to 15mm length               |

### Tools

| Tool       | Count | Specification / Notes |
| ---------- | ----- | --------------------- |
| 2.5 mm Hex | 1     | To fit the M3 bolts   |

<Info>
  The M3 bolts for both the board mount and cover can be between 8mm and 15mm in length. Choose a length that provides secure mounting without protruding excessively.

## Step-by-Step Assembly

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mount the Control Board">
    Take the OSSM Control Board and the PCB Extrusion Frame Mount.

    The board will slide under a small protrusion on the mount. It's a tight fit, so you may need to gently push it into place.

    <Tip>
      If the board doesn't slide in easily, check that it's oriented correctly. The protrusion on the mount should engage with the corresponding feature on the board.
    </Tip>
    <Check>
      The control board is fully seated under the protrusion on the mount and sits flush against the mounting surface.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secure the Board">
    Use the two M3 bolts to secure the control board to its mount.

    Tighten them just enough to hold the board in place and prevent it from moving.

    <Warning>
      Do not overtighten the bolts. Excessive torque can damage the PCB or strip the threads in the mount. The board should be secure but not under excessive stress.
    </Warning>
    <Check>
      The control board is securely mounted and does not move when gently pressed. Both M3 bolts are tightened evenly.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach the Cover">
    Place the Cover (Electronics Board) over the assembly.

    Ensure the cover aligns properly with the mounting holes and sits flush on the mount.

    <Info>
      The cover protects the control board from dust, debris, and accidental contact during operation.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secure the Cover">
    Use the remaining four M3 bolts to secure the cover.

    Tighten the bolts evenly to ensure the cover sits flat and provides proper protection.

    <Tip>
      Tighten the bolts in a cross pattern (opposite corners first) to ensure even pressure and prevent the cover from warping.
    </Tip>
    <Check>
      The cover is securely attached with all four M3 bolts tightened evenly. The cover should sit flush against the mount with no gaps or misalignment.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

With the electronics board mounted and covered, you're ready to proceed with wiring the voltage and data cables in the next section of the build guide.
