title: "11. Initial Test"
description: "Connect a controller and power to perform homing and verify your OSSM actuator operates correctly"
---

The initial test confirms that your OSSM actuator is assembled correctly and ready for use. You will connect a controller (wired remote or RADR wireless remote), apply power, observe the automatic homing sequence, and run a short test stroke.

## Prerequisites

- Actuator fully assembled and securely mounted
- Motor and control board wired per your kit instructions
- Clear workspace with at least 200 mm of free travel in front of the end effector
- If using the RADR wireless remote, update your OSSM firmware to 2.0.0 or newer. See <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/flashing-your-ossm">Flashing your OSSM</a>

<Warning>
Keep hands, hair, cables, and clothing away from moving parts and pinch points during power‑on and testing.
</Warning>

## Required Components and Tools

### Components

| Component | Count | Specification / Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----------------------|
| 24 mm Nut | 1 | Secures attachments to the threaded end of the End Effector |
| OSSM Wired Remote (RJ45) or RADR Wireless Remote | 1 | Choose the controller you have on hand |
| Power Source | 1 | 24 V DC power supply compatible with your OSSM control board |

### Tools

No tools are required for this test.

<Note>
The 24 mm nut is not required for motion testing, but installing it now confirms the threads are clean and ready for attachments.
</Note>

## Step-by-Step: Initial Test

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare the end effector">
Install the 24 mm nut on the threaded end of the End Effector by turning it clockwise until it seats on the flat.

<Info>
This confirms the threading is clean and that the nut engages fully before you add any attachments.
</Info>

<Check>
The 24 mm nut threads on smoothly by hand and sits flush against the end of the threaded section.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Prepare your workspace">
Ensure the actuator has unobstructed travel and the stand/mount is stable.

<Warning>
Never place body parts in line with the actuator during power‑on. Keep the rail area clear to avoid pinch points.
</Warning>

<Check>
The OSSM is stable and there is at least 200 mm of free travel ahead of the End Effector.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect your controller">
Use the tab that matches your setup.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Wired Remote (RJ45)">
Firmly insert the wired remote’s RJ45 connector into the control board’s remote port until it clicks.

<Info>
This is a remote-control port that uses an RJ45 connector style. It is not an Ethernet/network connection.
</Info>

<Check>
The RJ45 plug is fully seated and does not pull out with a light tug.
</Check>
</Tab>

<Tab title="RADR Wireless Remote">
- Confirm your OSSM runs firmware 2.0.0+ (update via <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/flashing-your-ossm">Flashing your OSSM</a>).
- Leave the OSSM powered off for now; you will power it on in the next step.
- Ensure the RADR has charge and is within a few feet of the OSSM. For control basics, see <a href="/research-and-desire-remote/quick-start">RADR Quick Start</a>.

<Check>
RADR has battery charge and is near the OSSM. Firmware requirements are met.
</Check>
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>

<Step title="Apply power">
Connect the 24 V DC power supply and switch the OSSM on.

<Warning>
Use only the specified voltage for your board. Incorrect voltage can damage electronics.
</Warning>

<Check>
The control board powers up. Any status LEDs on the board or controller illuminate.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Observe automatic homing">
After power‑on, the actuator will perform automatic sensorless homing.

- Expect a brief movement as the system finds its reference position
- The controller display (wired) or board LEDs will indicate the unit is active

<Info>
OSSM boards use sensorless homing—no limit switches required. A small extend/retract motion is normal as the controller establishes its zero position.
</Info>

<Check>
Homing completes without errors and the actuator stops at a reference position.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify homing direction">
Watch the first movement during homing.

- Expected behavior: the threaded end extends slightly, then retracts to its reference

<Warning>
If the actuator retracts first and then extends (reversed direction), power off and review your motor wiring before continuing. See <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/ossm-electronics/wiring-your-gold-motor">Motor Wiring</a>
</Warning>

<Check>
The threaded end extends first, then retracts. Direction is correct.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Perform a short test stroke">
Run a gentle motion test using your controller.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Wired Remote (RJ45)">
- Set a small stroke length (for example, 10–20 mm) and a shallow depth
- Slowly increase speed to ~10–20% until the actuator moves
- Observe for smooth, consistent motion without binding or unusual sounds

<Tip>
Make only small adjustments at a time. If you hear grinding or see stuttering, stop and investigate alignment, belt tension, and wiring before proceeding.
</Tip>

<Check>
The actuator moves smoothly at low speed with the configured small stroke.
</Check>
</Tab>

<Tab title="RADR Wireless Remote">
- Power on the RADR. After the OSSM finishes homing, RADR should auto‑pair
- Use the left knob to set a low speed
- Use the right knob to select Stroke mode, then set a small stroke (one or two rings)
- Verify smooth motion at low speed; adjust depth slightly if needed

<Info>
For RADR control details (Play Controls and Pattern Mode), see <a href="/research-and-desire-remote/quick-start">RADR Quick Start</a>
</Info>

<Check>
RADR is connected and the actuator performs a small, smooth stroke at low speed.
</Check>
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>

<Step title="Stop the test safely">
- Reduce speed to zero, then pause/stop motion
- Power off the OSSM when finished

<Tip>
On RADR, a single press of the middle button pauses; a double press stops and resets to defaults. See <a href="/research-and-desire-remote/quick-start">RADR Quick Start</a> for control references.
</Tip>

<Check>
Motion has stopped and the OSSM is powered down or idle.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="No movement during homing">
- Confirm the 24 V supply is connected and switched on
- Check all board connectors are fully seated
- Power cycle the OSSM and try again
- If still stuck, recheck <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/ossm-electronics/wiring-your-gold-motor">motor wiring</a>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Movement direction is reversed">
- Power off immediately
- Verify motor phase wiring order and polarity
- Correct wiring per <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/ossm-electronics/wiring-your-gold-motor">Motor Wiring guide</a>, then retest
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Wired remote does not light or respond">
- Reseat the RJ45 until it clicks; try the other end of the cable
- Inspect the connector for bent pins or debris
- Confirm the board is powered and LEDs are on
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="RADR will not connect">
- Ensure OSSM firmware is 2.0.0+ and complete homing first
- Keep the RADR within a few feet of the OSSM
- Power cycle both devices, then try again
- See <a href="/research-and-desire-remote/quick-start">RADR Quick Start</a> and <a href="/research-and-desire-remote/device-support">Device Support</a>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unusual noise, binding, or stuttering">
- Stop the motion and power off
- Check rail alignment, belt tension, and that nothing obstructs travel
- Resume testing at low speed and short stroke
