## What is OSSM?

**OSSM** (pronounced like "awesome") is an open-source, servo-powered sex machine built around a belt-driven linear rail. You can assemble it yourself from printed parts and readily available hardware, or start from a kit. OSSM emphasizes quiet operation, high torque, and software-defined control of stroke and depth.

<Tip>
OSSM’s actuator enables precise, repeatable motion with adjustable depth, speed, and patterns. Typical builds reach up to 1 m/s stroke speed with strong thrust at any rail position.

<Accordion title="Video transcript (edited for clarity)">
I’ve tried other sex machines that stalled with larger toys or at longer strokes. OSSM handled those scenarios reliably, and I was able to build it myself in colors I love. The build process was straightforward, and the performance is smooth and powerful. Thanks, Research and Desire.

## Performance overview

A standard OSSM build delivers the following capabilities (actual performance depends on motor, power supply, rail length, and configuration):

- Top speed: up to 1 m/s
- Stroke length: ~8 in (20 cm) with a 350 mm rail; longer rails support longer strokes
- Force output: 40+ lbf (≈18+ kgf) in typical configurations
- Control: software-defined stroke, depth, speed, and patterns

<Note>
Values above reflect commonly used configurations and parts. Your exact results may vary based on chosen motor, voltage, and rail length.
</Note>

## Why build an OSSM?

- **Fine-grained control:** Adjust depth, stroke length, and speed in software, and switch patterns on the fly.
- **Quiet and compact:** Belt-driven actuator and efficient motor design support discreet operation.
- **Mod-friendly:** Open designs, printable parts, and community mods make customization straightforward.
- **Great for learning:** Build skills in 3D printing, mechanics, electronics, and embedded software.

## Safety first

<Warning>
Before use, verify secure mounting, clear pinch‑point zones, and smooth actuator motion. Start at low speeds, increase gradually, and stop immediately if anything feels unsafe or unusual. Keep fingers, hair, clothing, and cords away from moving parts.
</Warning>

<Info>
OSSM performs a homing routine on startup. Ensure nothing obstructs travel before powering on.
