## What is OSSM?

**OSSM** (pronounced like "awesome") is a user-friendly, open-source sex machine designed for everyday use. Whether you're curious about sex machines or looking to build your own, OSSM provides a powerful, customizable solution you can assemble at home.

<Tip>
OSSM uses a servo-powered belt-driven linear rail, enabling quiet operation, high torque, and software-defined stroke and depth control at speeds up to 1 meter per second.

I've tried other sex machines before, but they would stall or not be able to handle bigger toys.

Not only can the OSSM do that, I also built it myself with custom colors. I really got to create my ultimate dream machine.

Oh, and did I mention how good this thing fucks?

*[Moaning]*

Yeah, I'm thinking about hopping back on it, just watching that.

Thank you, Research and Desire.
