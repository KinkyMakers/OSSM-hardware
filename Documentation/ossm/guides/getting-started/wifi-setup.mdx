Connecting your OSSM to WiFi enables over-the-air firmware updates and other network-based features. This guide covers two methods for configuring your WiFi credentials.

<Note>
Your OSSM only supports 2.4GHz WiFi networks. This is a hardware limitation of the ESP32 microcontroller. 5GHz networks will not appear in the network list.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Your WiFi network name (SSID)
- Your WiFi password
- A 2.4GHz WiFi network (5GHz is not supported)

## Choose your setup method

Configure wirelessly using a web browser—no wired remote required.
</Card>
<Card title="Option 2: Wired Remote" icon="display" href="#option-2-wired-remote-captive-portal">
Use the OSSM's built-in display and encoder to set up WiFi.

## Option 1: Web BLE Controller

The Web BLE Controller provides a browser-based interface for configuring your OSSM wirelessly. This method works best for users without a wired remote or who prefer a graphical interface.

<Note>
The Web BLE Controller requires a browser with Web Bluetooth support, such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Safari does not currently support Web Bluetooth.
</Note>

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Web Controller">
Navigate to the [Web BLE Controller](https://docs.researchanddesire.com/ossm/tools/web-controller) in a compatible browser (Chrome or Edge).
</Step>

<Step title="Connect to your OSSM">
Click the **Connect** button and select your OSSM from the Bluetooth pairing dialog. Your OSSM will appear in the list with its Bluetooth name.

<Tip>
If your OSSM doesn't appear, ensure it's powered on and within Bluetooth range (typically 10 meters).
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to WiFi Settings">
Once connected, click the **WiFi Settings** tab at the top of the controller interface.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter your WiFi credentials">
Fill in the WiFi configuration form:

- **Network Name (SSID)**: Enter your WiFi network name (maximum 32 characters)
- **Password**: Enter your WiFi password (8-63 characters required)

<Warning>
The password must be between 8 and 63 characters. Passwords shorter than 8 characters will not be accepted.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Save and connect">
Click the **Save & Connect** button. The OSSM will attempt to connect to your WiFi network.

The status indicator will display:
- **✓ Connected** — Successfully connected to WiFi
- **○ Not Connected** — Connection failed or still attempting

If connected, you'll see your network SSID, IP address, and signal strength (RSSI).
</Step>
</Steps>

## Option 2: Wired Remote (Captive Portal)

If you have the wired remote with the OLED display, you can configure WiFi directly from the device using the built-in captive portal system.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access WiFi Setup from the menu">
From the main menu on your OSSM's display:

1. Use the encoder to scroll to **WiFi Setup**
2. Press the encoder button to select it

The display will show WiFi setup information and a QR code for easy connection.
</Step>

<Step title="Connect to OSSM Setup network">
On your phone or computer, open your WiFi settings and connect to the network named:

**OSSM Setup**

<Info>
This network has no password. The QR code displayed on the OSSM's screen can be scanned to connect automatically on supported devices.
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure via captive portal">
After connecting to the OSSM Setup network, a configuration page should open automatically. If it doesn't, manually navigate to:

```
http://192.168.4.1
```

On the configuration page:
1. Select your home WiFi network from the list (only 2.4GHz networks appear)
2. Enter your WiFi password
3. Click **Save** or **Submit**
</Step>

<Step title="Verify connection">
The OSSM will save your credentials and attempt to connect. If successful, the display will show:

- Your network SSID
- Your OSSM's IP address on the network

The captive portal will automatically close, and you'll be disconnected from the OSSM Setup network.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Resetting WiFi credentials

If you need to clear saved WiFi credentials or connect to a different network:

1. Navigate to **WiFi Setup** in the main menu
2. **Long press** the encoder button (hold for 3 seconds)
3. The stored credentials will be erased
4. The OSSM will restart, allowing you to configure WiFi again

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="My 5GHz network doesn't appear">
The ESP32 microcontroller only supports 2.4GHz WiFi networks. 5GHz networks will not appear in the network list. Ensure your router broadcasts a 2.4GHz network, or use a dual-band network name that supports both frequencies.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Captive portal doesn't open automatically">
If the captive portal configuration page doesn't open after connecting to the OSSM Setup network, manually open a web browser and navigate to:

```
http://192.168.4.1
```

This is the direct IP address of the OSSM's configuration server.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Connection keeps failing">
If your OSSM repeatedly fails to connect:

- Verify your WiFi password is correct (passwords are case-sensitive)
- Ensure your router supports 2.4GHz
- Check that your router allows new device connections (some routers have device limits)
- Try moving your OSSM closer to your router to improve signal strength
- Reset WiFi credentials (long press on WiFi Setup) and try again
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I check if WiFi is working?">
If your OSSM successfully connects to WiFi, you can verify by:

1. Using the Web BLE Controller's WiFi Settings tab—click **Refresh** to see current connection status
2. Checking the wired remote display when entering WiFi Setup—it will show "Connected to: [your network]" if online
3. Testing the **Update** feature from the main menu—firmware updates require WiFi connectivity
