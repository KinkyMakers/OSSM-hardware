# OSSM Analysis Tools

The Analysis toolkit provides tools for measuring and analyzing OSSM motion from video recordings using computer vision.

## Overview

These tools allow you to:

- **Calibrate** pixel-to-millimeter conversion using a known reference length
- **Track** a point on the OSSM through video frames
- **Export** position-time data for further analysis

## Use Cases

### Performance Verification

Verify that your OSSM is achieving the expected stroke length and speed by tracking the end effector position over time.

### Pattern Analysis

Analyze the actual motion patterns being executed and compare them to the commanded patterns.

### Troubleshooting

Identify mechanical issues like belt slip, vibration, or inconsistent motion by examining the position data.

### Development

When developing new patterns or motion profiles, use video analysis to verify the actual output matches your expectations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (recommended)
- A video recording of your OSSM in motion
- A reference measurement on the linear rail (for calibration)
