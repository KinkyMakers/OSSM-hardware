# Video Tracker

The Video Tracker tool analyzes video recordings of an OSSM to extract position-time data using OpenCV computer vision.

## Features

- Load any standard video format (MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.)
- **iPhone slo-mo support** (120fps/240fps)
- Interactive calibration using a known reference length
- Point tracking with adjustable tracking circle
- Real-time visualization during tracking
- CSV export for further analysis

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Load Video">
    The tool loads your video file and extracts the first frame for setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calibrate Scale">
    You draw a line along a known length (like the linear rail) and enter the real-world dimension in millimeters. This establishes the pixel-to-mm conversion.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Tracking Point">
    Click to place a tracking circle on the point you want to follow (typically the end effector or a high-contrast marker).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Video">
    The tool processes each frame, tracking the selected point and calculating its position along the calibration axis.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Export Data">
    Position-time data is saved to a CSV file for analysis in your preferred tools.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Output Format

The exported CSV contains the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `frame` | Frame number (0-indexed) |
| `time_s` | Time in seconds |
| `position_mm` | Position along the calibration axis in millimeters |
| `raw_x` | Raw pixel X coordinate |
| `raw_y` | Raw pixel Y coordinate |

## Tips for Best Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Lighting">
    Ensure consistent, even lighting throughout the video. Avoid shadows that move across the tracking point.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Camera Position">
    Mount the camera perpendicular to the direction of motion. Avoid angles that cause perspective distortion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tracking Point">
    Use a high-contrast marker (like a bright sticker or tape) on the end effector for more reliable tracking.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Frame Rate">
    Higher frame rates capture faster movements more accurately. 60fps or higher is recommended for high-speed operation. iPhone slo-mo (120/240fps) is excellent for capturing fast strokes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="iPhone Slo-Mo Videos">
    iPhone slow-motion videos use variable frame rate (VFR) - normal sections are 30fps while the slo-mo portion is 120/240fps. For the most accurate timing data, trim your video to just the slow-motion section before analysis. The Photos app or iMovie can export just the slo-mo portion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Calibration Line">
    Draw the calibration line along the exact path of motion for the most accurate position measurements.
