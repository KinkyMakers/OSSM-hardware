# Installation

The Video Tracker is a Python application that uses OpenCV for video processing. We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, reliable dependency management.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- A terminal/command prompt

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install uv">
    If you don't have uv installed, run:
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
        ```bash
        curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Windows">
        ```powershell
        powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Clone or Download">
    Get the Analysis tools from the OSSM repository:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware.git
    cd OSSM-hardware/Analysis
    ```
    
    Or if you already have the repository:
    
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/OSSM-hardware/Analysis
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Sync Dependencies">
    Let uv create the virtual environment and install dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
    
    This will:
    - Create a `.venv` directory
    - Install OpenCV and NumPy
    - Set up the project for use
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify Installation

Test that everything is working:

```bash
uv run python -c "import cv2; print(f'OpenCV {cv2.__version__} installed successfully')"
```

You should see output like:

```
OpenCV 4.13.0 installed successfully
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="uv: command not found">
    Make sure uv is in your PATH. You may need to restart your terminal or add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH:
    
    ```bash
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
    ```
    
    Add this line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` to make it permanent.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Python version errors">
    The tool requires Python 3.10+. Check your version:
    
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
    
    If needed, install a newer Python version using your system's package manager or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="OpenCV import errors">
    If OpenCV fails to import, try reinstalling:
    
    ```bash
    uv sync --reinstall
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Project Structure

After setup, your Analysis directory will contain:

```
Analysis/
├── .venv/              # Virtual environment (created by uv)
├── ossm_tracker.py     # Main tracking application
├── pyproject.toml      # Project configuration
├── README.md           # Quick reference
└── .gitignore          # Ignores venv and output files
```
