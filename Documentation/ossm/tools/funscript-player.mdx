import { OssmFunscriptPlayer } from "/snippets/ossm/funscript-player.jsx"

Sync your OSSM with funscript files for video-synchronized playback. Load a video and matching `.funscript` file, connect via Bluetooth, and enjoy automated motion control.

<OssmFunscriptPlayer />

## Requirements

- **OSSM firmware**: Version 3.0 or later (with BLE streaming support)
- **Compatible browser**: Chrome, Edge, or Opera on desktop/Android
- **Bluetooth**: Enabled on your device
- **Funscript file**: A `.funscript` file matching your video

<Note>
Web Bluetooth is **not supported** on iOS devices (iPhone/iPad) or in Safari/Firefox browsers. For these platforms, consider using third-party funscript players with [Buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io) integration.
</Note>

## How to Use

<Steps>
  <Step title="Load your media files">
    Click the file pickers to select your video file and matching `.funscript` file. The funscript filename should match the video filename (e.g., `my-video.mp4` and `my-video.funscript`).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect to your OSSM">
    Click **Connect to OSSM** and select your device from the Bluetooth list. The OSSM will automatically enter streaming mode.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Play the video">
    Press play on the video player. Position commands are sent in real-time as the video plays, keeping your OSSM synchronized with the content.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What is Funscript?

Funscript is a JSON-based file format used to synchronize toy movements with video content. Each funscript contains a series of position/time pairs that define where the device should move at specific moments during playback.

```json Example funscript structure
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "actions": [
    { "pos": 0, "at": 1000 },
    { "pos": 99, "at": 2000 },
    { "pos": 0, "at": 3000 }
  ]
}
```

- **pos**: Position from 0 (fully retracted) to 99 (fully extended)
- **at**: Timestamp in milliseconds

<Info>
Funscripts can be created using tools like [OpenFunscripter](https://github.com/OpenFunscripter/OpenFunscripter) or purchased from marketplaces like [RealSync](https://realsync.us/).
</Info>

## Playback Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Time Offset** | Adjust sync timing (-500ms to +500ms). Use positive values if the OSSM is behind the video, negative if ahead. |
| **Look-ahead** | How far ahead to send commands (0-500ms). Higher values help compensate for BLE latency but may reduce responsiveness. |

## Safety Features

- **Auto-stop on disconnect**: If Bluetooth connection is lost, the OSSM ramps down safely
- **Return to menu on disconnect**: When you disconnect, the OSSM returns to the main menu
- **Manual control**: You can pause the video at any time to stop motion

<Warning>
Always ensure you have easy access to pause the video or disconnect from the OSSM. Start with slower content to verify sync timing before using faster scripts.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OSSM not responding to commands">
    - Ensure the OSSM shows "streaming" mode on its display after connecting
    - Check the debug logs for any error messages
    - Try disconnecting and reconnecting
    - Verify your OSSM firmware supports streaming mode (v3.0+)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Motion is out of sync with video">
    - Adjust the **Time Offset** slider to compensate for delays
    - Increase the **Look-ahead** value if motion seems late
    - Ensure your device isn't experiencing Bluetooth interference
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Funscript file not loading">
    - Verify the file has a `.funscript` or `.json` extension
    - Check that the file contains valid JSON with an `actions` array
    - Look for parsing errors in the debug logs
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Choppy or stuttering motion">
    - Close other Bluetooth-connected devices to reduce interference
    - Stay within 10 meters of your OSSM
    - Try reducing video quality if your device is struggling
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical Details

The funscript player uses the OSSM's native streaming protocol via BLE:

- **Command format**: `stream:position:time` where position is 0-100 and time is milliseconds to reach the target
- **Update rate**: Commands are sent every 10ms when new actions are due
- **BLE characteristic**: Uses the primary OSSM command characteristic (`522b443a-4f53-534d-1000-420badbabe69`)
