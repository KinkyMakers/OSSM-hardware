import { OssmBleController } from "/snippets/ossm/ble-controller.jsx"

Control your OSSM wirelessly from any compatible browser using Web Bluetooth. No apps or additional software required.

<OssmBleController />

## Requirements

- **OSSM firmware**: Version 3.0 or later (with BLE support)
- **Compatible browser**: Chrome, Edge, or Opera on desktop/Android
- **Bluetooth**: Enabled on your device

<Note>
Web Bluetooth is **not supported** on iOS devices (iPhone/iPad) or in Safari/Firefox browsers. For these platforms, consider using the [RADR wireless controller](https://www.researchanddesire.com/products/radr-ossm-wireless-remote) instead.
</Note>

## How to Use

1. Ensure your OSSM is powered on and running the latest firmware
2. Click the **Connect** button above
3. Select your OSSM from the Bluetooth device list
4. Use the sliders to control speed, depth, stroke, and sensation
5. Select different patterns using the pattern buttons

## How It Works

The web controller connects directly to your OSSM via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). All communication happens locally between your browser and the device — no data is sent to any servers.

### Available Controls

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Speed** | Controls motor speed (0-100%) |
| **Depth** | Adjusts penetration depth (0-100%) |
| **Stroke** | Sets stroke length (0-100%) |
| **Sensation** | Modifies stroke feel/profile (0-100%) |
| **Pattern** | Selects from available motion patterns |

### Safety Features

- **Pause**: Immediately stops all motion
- **Auto-stop on disconnect**: Device returns to menu when connection is lost

<Warning>
The **Pause** button immediately stops all motion. Use it if you need to stop the device quickly.
</Warning>
