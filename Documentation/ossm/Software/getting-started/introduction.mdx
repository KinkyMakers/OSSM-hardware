# Firmware Overview

The Open Source Sex Machine (OSSM) firmware is an ESP32-based control system that manages motion, user input, and communication for your device. This guide walks you through the project architecture and helps you set up your development environment.

## Core Technologies

The OSSM firmware relies on four key technologies that work together to deliver responsive, reliable motion control.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="State Machine - Boost SML" icon="diagram-project">
[Boost SML](https://boost-ext.github.io/sml/) (State Machine Language) is a header-only C++ library that provides a domain-specific language for defining state machines.

**Why we use it:**
- Compile-time state machine verification catches errors before runtime
- Zero runtime overhead compared to manual switch/case implementations
- Clean, declarative syntax makes complex state transitions readable
- Handles transitions between states like idle, running, error, and homing

The state machine governs the device's operational modes, ensuring safe transitions and predictable behavior. For details, see the [State Machine Architecture](/ossm/Software/architecture/state-machine) documentation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Display - U8G2 Library" icon="display">
[U8G2](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2) is a monochrome graphics library optimized for embedded systems and OLED displays.

**Why we use it:**
- Supports a wide range of display controllers including SSD1306 and SH1106
- Minimal memory footprint suitable for ESP32's constrained RAM
- Built-in font rendering with multiple sizes and styles
- Hardware-accelerated drawing for smooth UI updates

U8G2 renders the on-device interface including speed, depth, pattern selection, and system status.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Task Management - FreeRTOS" icon="layer-group">
[FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) is a real-time operating system kernel that enables multitasking on embedded devices.

**Why we use it:**
- Runs multiple concurrent tasks (motion control, display updates, input handling)
- Priority-based scheduling ensures time-critical motion tasks execute reliably
- Inter-task communication via queues and semaphores
- Integrated into the ESP32 Arduino framework by default

FreeRTOS allows the firmware to simultaneously process user input, update the display, and maintain precise motor timing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Motion Control - StrokeEngine" icon="wave-pulse">
[StrokeEngine](https://github.com/theelims/StrokeEngine) is a motion pattern library created by theelims, modified for OSSM-specific requirements.

**Why we use it:**
- Generates smooth, customizable motion patterns with configurable speed and depth
- Supports multiple pattern types (constant, random, oscillating, and more)
- Handles acceleration ramping for motor protection
- Provides real-time parameter adjustment without motion interruption

StrokeEngine translates user settings into precise motor commands, enabling the variety of motion patterns available in OSSM.

## Getting Started

Set up your development environment by following these steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Git installed on your system
- An internet connection to download dependencies

<Steps>
<Step title="Install VS Code and PlatformIO">
Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), then add the PlatformIO extension.

1. Open VS Code
2. Navigate to the Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
3. Search for "PlatformIO IDE"
4. Click **Install** and wait for the installation to complete
5. Restart VS Code when prompted

<Tip>
For detailed PlatformIO setup instructions, see our [PlatformIO setup guide](/ossm/Software/getting-started/PlatformIO).
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Clone the repository">
Open a terminal and clone the OSSM repository to your local machine.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="HTTPS">
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware.git
cd OSSM-hardware/Software
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="SSH">
```bash
git clone git@github.com:KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware.git
cd OSSM-hardware/Software
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="GitHub CLI">
```bash
gh repo clone KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware
cd OSSM-hardware/Software
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
If you plan to contribute changes, fork the repository first, then clone your fork instead.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Open the project in VS Code">
Launch the project using PlatformIO.

1. Open VS Code
2. Select **File > Open Folder**
3. Navigate to the `OSSM-hardware/Software` directory you just cloned
4. Click **Select Folder** (or **Open** on macOS)

PlatformIO automatically detects the `platformio.ini` file and configures the project.

<Check>
You should see the PlatformIO toolbar appear at the bottom of VS Code with build, upload, and monitor buttons.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Build and upload the firmware">
Compile the project and flash it to your ESP32.

1. Connect your ESP32 board via USB
2. Click the **PlatformIO: Build** button (checkmark icon) to compile
3. Once the build succeeds, click **PlatformIO: Upload** (arrow icon) to flash the firmware

<Warning>
Ensure you select the correct COM port if you have multiple serial devices connected. You can configure this in `platformio.ini` or through the PlatformIO device monitor.
</Warning>
