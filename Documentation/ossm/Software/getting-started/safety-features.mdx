The OSSM firmware includes several safety features designed to prevent accidents, protect hardware, and ensure predictable operation. This guide explains each safety mechanism and how it works.

<Warning>
Safety features are a supplement to—not a replacement for—safe usage practices. Always follow the [safety guidance](/ossm/guides/housekeeping/safety/guidance) when operating your OSSM.
</Warning>

## Preflight safety check

Before entering any operating mode, the OSSM performs a preflight check to prevent accidental high-speed starts.

### How it works

When you select Simple Penetration or Stroke Engine from the menu:

1. The firmware reads the speed potentiometer
2. If speed is above 1% (`commandDeadZonePercentage`), a warning screen appears
3. The warning displays current speed and instructs you to decrease it
4. Once speed drops below 1%, the mode starts automatically

### What you'll see

```
Simple Penetration
Speed: 45%
Decrease the speed to begin playing.
```

### Bypassing preflight

You cannot bypass the preflight check. The mode will not start until the speed knob is near zero. This ensures you always begin at a safe speed and consciously increase it.

<Tip>
If the preflight screen appears, simply turn your speed knob fully counterclockwise. The mode will start within a second once the reading drops below the threshold.
</Tip>

### Exiting preflight

**Long-press the encoder** to return to the main menu without starting the mode.

## BLE disconnection safety

When controlling your OSSM via Bluetooth, an unexpected disconnect could leave the device running at high speed. The firmware includes automatic ramp-down to prevent this.

### How it works

When a BLE connection is lost:

1. The firmware captures the current speed at disconnect
2. After a **1 second delay**, the ramp-down begins
3. Over **2 seconds**, speed decreases to zero using an ease-in-out-sine curve
4. The device continues running at zero speed until reconnected or manually stopped

### Why the delay?

The 1-second delay prevents false triggers from momentary signal dropouts. Brief interference won't cause unnecessary slowdowns during normal operation.

### Ramp curve

The ease-in-out-sine curve provides smooth deceleration:

- Starts slowly (gentle initial deceleration)
- Accelerates through the middle of the ramp
- Ends slowly (gentle final stop)

This feels more natural than linear deceleration and reduces mechanical stress.

<Note>
If the speed was already zero when the connection dropped, no ramp occurs—the device simply continues at rest.
</Note>

### Manual override

Local controls (potentiometer and encoder) remain active during and after disconnect. You can:

- Manually stop the device using the speed knob
- Long-press the encoder for emergency stop
- Reconnect via BLE to resume control

## Homing safety

The homing sequence includes several safety checks to detect mechanical problems before operation begins.

### Timeout protection

Homing must complete within **40 seconds**. If the actuator hasn't found both ends of travel within this time:

1. The motor stops
2. An error screen displays: "Homing took too long. Please check your wiring and try again."
3. A QR code appears linking to troubleshooting resources
4. Press the encoder to restart

**Common causes of timeout:**
- Insufficient power supply
- Disconnected motor wiring
- Mechanical obstruction
- Belt too loose or broken

### Current sensing

The OSSM uses sensorless homing—it detects end-of-travel by monitoring motor current. When current exceeds `sensorlessCurrentLimit` (default: 1.5%), the firmware knows the actuator has reached a physical stop.

<Info>
Sensorless homing eliminates the need for limit switches while still detecting mechanical boundaries reliably.
</Info>

### Minimum stroke validation

After homing, the firmware validates that the measured stroke length exceeds `minStrokeLengthMm` (default: 50mm). If the stroke is too short:

1. An error screen displays: "Stroke too short. Please check your drive belt."
2. The device enters error state
3. Press the encoder to view help, then press again to restart

**Common causes of short stroke:**
- Belt slipping on pulleys
- Belt tension too loose
- Mechanical binding or obstruction
- Incorrect motor configuration

### Offset buffer

After detecting each end of travel, the actuator backs off by `strokeZeroOffsetMm` (default: 6mm). This buffer:

- Prevents the actuator from repeatedly hitting the physical endstop
- Provides a safety margin for position errors
- Reduces wear on mechanical components

## Emergency stop

At any time during operation, you can trigger an immediate stop.

### How to trigger

**Long-press the encoder for approximately 3 seconds** from any operating mode.

### What happens

1. `forceStop()` is called on the stepper driver
2. Motor outputs are disabled immediately
3. The device is marked as "not homed"
4. You return to the main menu

<Warning>
Emergency stop causes the OSSM to lose its position reference. You must restart and re-home before operating again.
</Warning>

### When to use

Use emergency stop when:

- Something feels wrong during operation
- You need to stop immediately for any reason
- The device behaves unexpectedly
- You hear unusual sounds from the mechanical system

<Note>
Don't hesitate to use emergency stop—it's there for your safety. Re-homing only takes a few seconds.
</Note>

## Error states

When the firmware detects a problem, it enters an error state with helpful information.

### Error screen

The error screen displays:

1. "Error" header
2. A description of the problem
3. Instructions for next steps

### Help screen

Press the encoder on the error screen to view the help screen, which displays:

- "Get Help" header
- Instructions to visit Discord or GitHub
- A QR code linking to [unbox.ossm.tech](https://unbox.ossm.tech)

Press the encoder again to restart the device.

## Configuration safety values

Several configuration parameters affect safety behavior:

| Parameter | Default | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `commandDeadZonePercentage` | 1.0% | Preflight threshold for speed knob |
| `sensorlessCurrentLimit` | 1.5% | Current threshold for homing detection |
| `minStrokeLengthMm` | 50mm | Minimum valid stroke after homing |
| `strokeZeroOffsetMm` | 6mm | Safety buffer from physical endstops |

<Warning>
Modifying these values can reduce safety margins. Only change them if you understand the implications and have tested thoroughly.
</Warning>
