title: "RGB LED Status Indication"
description: "Understand the RGB LED patterns that indicate BLE connection status and machine operations on your OSSM"
---

The RGB LED on pin 25 provides visual feedback about your OSSM's current state. You can quickly identify whether the machine is homing, searching for a Bluetooth connection, or actively communicating with a connected device.

## Understanding status priority

The LED displays different patterns based on the current operational state. Machine operations always take priority over BLE status indications.

| Priority | State | LED Pattern |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Highest | Homing | Deep purple breathing effect |
| Lower | BLE Status | Varies by connection state |

## Machine status patterns

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Homing in progress">
When your OSSM is homing, the LED displays a **deep purple breathing effect** with a smooth pulsing pattern. This continues until homing completes or fails.

<Info>
The homing indicator takes priority over all BLE status patterns. You won't see BLE status changes until homing finishes.

## BLE connection status patterns

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Advertising (searching for connections)">
When your OSSM is searching for a Bluetooth connection:

1. **Rainbow effect** displays for 1 second
2. **Fast breathing blue** follows with rapid pulsing (10x normal speed)
3. **Auto-dim** activates after 30 seconds, reducing to ~12% brightness with gentle pulsing

<Tip>
The auto-dim feature reduces visual distraction if you're using a wired remote instead of Bluetooth. The LED remains visible but won't be distracting during extended sessions.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Connected">
When a device connects via Bluetooth:

1. **Rainbow effect** displays for 1 second to confirm connection
2. **Blue LED fades** to a dim level (~12% brightness) and stays dimmed
3. **Communication pulses** appear as subtle brightness increases during data transfer

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Disconnected">
When no Bluetooth connection exists:

- **LED turns off** completely

<Note>
A disconnected state differs from advertising. If you power on the OSSM, it begins advertising immediately, so you'll see the blue breathing pattern rather than no light.
</Note>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Communication indication

When BLE is connected and the LED is dimmed, you'll see brief brightness pulses during:

- **Receiving commands** from your connected device
- **Sending responses** back to the device
- **State updates** transmitted to the device

<Info>
The communication pulse is subtle—a 100ms fade with minimal brightness increase. This provides feedback without being distracting during operation.
</Info>

## Technical reference

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Configuration constants">
| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `ADVERTISING_TIMEOUT` | 30 seconds | Time before advertising dims automatically |
| Dimmed brightness | ~12% | Brightness level when connected or after timeout |
| Communication pulse | 100ms | Duration of data transfer indication |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Key functions">
| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `showBLEAdvertisingDimmed()` | Displays gentle pulsing at reduced brightness |

<Note>
The advertising timeout resets automatically when the BLE connection status changes (connect or disconnect events).
