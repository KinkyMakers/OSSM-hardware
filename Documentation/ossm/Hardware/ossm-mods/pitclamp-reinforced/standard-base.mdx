## Printing

Use these standard PitClamp Mini print settings for all components.

### Print settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Walls | 6 |
| Infill type | Cross Hatch or Gyroid |
| Infill percentage | 10% |
| Supports | Normal (Snug) with 3° threshold angle |
| Support placement | Allow supports on part |
| Seam | Nearest (or your preference) |

<Note>
**Recommended filament:** PLA+ for optimal strength and durability.
</Note>

<Warning>
All parts must print in the default file orientation. Printing Base components in other orientations causes structural weakness that may lead to failure under load.
</Warning>

### Print-in-place option

If your printer is well calibrated and your material has optimal layer adhesion, you can use the print-in-place Upper+Handle variant. Find this in the `/Non-Standard` folder.
