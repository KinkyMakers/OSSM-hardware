<Note>
The AIO version shown in these pictures mounts the control board in the front with cables routing to the motor in the back, based on a concept by @thearmpit. The AIO Cover part used here is a custom design not covered under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
</Note>

This modification replaces the standard belt drive with a capstan-based system, enabling higher load capacity with the more powerful 60AIM40F motor.

## What is a capstan drive?

A capstan drive uses rope and a pulley to transmit motion. For an excellent explanation of the mechanism, watch this video by Aaed Musa:

  Learn how capstan drives work and why they're effective for high-torque applications.
</Card>

## Why choose capstan over belt?

The standard belt-driven OSSM can experience slipping at higher torques. While this may result from build errors, the capstan drive eliminates this issue entirely.

### Comparison to standard OSSM

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Advantages">
    - Same form factor as standard OSSM
    - Equal or quieter operation
    - Only 13cm effective rail length loss (450mm rail = 32cm stroke)
    - **2.7x stronger** (32kg vs 12kg capacity)
    - Same maximum speed
    - No belt slipping
    - No custom PCBs required
    - PitClamp compatible
    - Compatible with all custom end effectors
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Disadvantages">
    - More complex build process
    - Larger motor increases cost (~110€ shipped including tax to Germany)
    - More parts to print
    - Rail may slip in extreme use cases (resolved by re-homing)
    - Limited community testing (single builder verified)

## Configuration options

### AIO vs normal version

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AIO (Recommended)">
    The AIO mod version mounts the control board in the front of the motor head with integrated cable routing. This is the recommended configuration.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Normal">
    The normal version includes no mounting solution for the control board. Choose this if you want to create your own custom mounting arrangement.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Pulley versions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Bushing Pulley (Recommended)">
    The bushing pulley is superior in every way:
    - Better durability
    - No deformation over time
    - Supports rail lengths up to 450mm (500mm likely possible)
    
    **Requirements**: Appropriately sized bushing and epoxy glue for assembly.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="3D Printed Pulley">
    Use the 3D printed pulley if you cannot source a suitable bushing:
    - Functional but will deform over time under constant force
    - Requires periodic replacement
    - Maximum supported rail length: 400mm
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Supported rail lengths

| Pulley Type | Tested Length | Maximum Recommended |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Bushing | 450mm | 500mm (untested) |
| 3D Printed | 400mm | 400mm |

<Warning>
Rail lengths above 500mm are not recommended for this design.
</Warning>

## Rope selection

<Warning>
Use only the specified rope type. Incorrect rope selection will result in stretching and failure.
</Warning>

**Required rope**: Liros DC pro 161 (or equivalent Dyneema DM20, SK99, SK75 with max 1mm diameter)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why rope selection matters">
    The rope must have minimal stretch under load. Testing by community member @neos demonstrated that generic UHMWPE rope from AliExpress stretches excessively and breaks under load. The specified Dyneema rope maintains consistent tension for reliable operation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Alternative rope specifications">
    If you cannot source Liros DC pro 161, look for:
    - Material: Dyneema DM20, SK99, or SK75
    - Maximum diameter: 1mm
    - Verified low-stretch construction
    
    Deviate from these specifications at your own risk.
  </Accordion>

## Print settings

<Note>
Pre-configured .3mf files are included for most parts with optimal settings.

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Walls | 6 |
| Infill | 20% |
| Supports | Try without for AIO_cover (bridges only); enable if needed |
