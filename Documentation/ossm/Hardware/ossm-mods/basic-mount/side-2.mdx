## Function

Side 2 is the mirrored counterpart to Side 1 in the Basic Mount bracket system. This component:

- Attaches to the right side of the OSSM actuator body
- Provides mounting points for securing the OSSM to a stand or surface
- Works in conjunction with Side 1 to clamp the actuator securely

<Warning>
Print this part in the default file orientation for optimal strength. The flat base should be on the print bed.
