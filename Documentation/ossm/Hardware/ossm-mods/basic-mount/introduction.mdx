description: "A simple, legacy mounting solution for the OSSM actuator using two printed brackets"
---

<Warning>
This is a legacy mount design. For new builds, consider the [PitClamp](/ossm/Hardware/standard-printed-parts/pitclamp/README) which offers more adjustability and stability.
</Warning>

The Basic Mount is a simple two-piece bracket system that attaches directly to the OSSM actuator body. It provides a straightforward mounting solution with minimal printed parts.

## Overview

The Basic Mount consists of two mirrored side brackets that clamp onto the OSSM body, plus an optional spacer for use with extrusion-based stands.
