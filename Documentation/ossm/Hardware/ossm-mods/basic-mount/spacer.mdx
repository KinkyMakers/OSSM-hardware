## Function

The Extrusion Mount Spacer is an optional component for the Basic Mount system. This part:

- Provides 5mm of spacing between the mount bracket and an aluminum extrusion stand
- Helps with alignment and clearance when mounting to 2020 or 4040 extrusion profiles
- Can be stacked for additional spacing as needed

<Note>
This spacer is optional and only needed when mounting to aluminum extrusion stands where additional clearance is required.
