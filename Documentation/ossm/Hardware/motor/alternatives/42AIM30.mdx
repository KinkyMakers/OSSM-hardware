title: "42AIM30 Round Motor"
description: "Compact 42 mm round variant of the 57AIM30 'Gold Motor'; identical performance with a smaller diameter but limited mounting options."
---

The 42AIM30 ("Round Motor") is a compact, cylindrical alternative to the standard 57AIM30 Gold Motor used with OSSM. It removes the external heatsink housing while keeping equivalent internals and performance characteristics.

<Warning>
The 42AIM30 has limited mounting support and typically requires custom hardware or an adapter. Choose this motor only if you have strict diameter constraints.
</Warning>

## Overview

- Form factor: 42 mm round body without an external heatsink
- Intended use: Space-constrained builds where the 57 mm square housing will not fit
- Electrical behavior: Works with the same OSSM wiring and control approach as the 57AIM30 Gold Motor. For wiring, follow /open-source-sex-machine/ossm-electronics/wiring-your-gold-motor

<Note>
If you are sourcing a 42AIM30 from a third-party vendor as a drop-in replacement for the Gold Motor, match the interface and base speed to your controller (commonly RS485 and ~1500 RPM). Confirm the exact variant and connector pinout with the vendor before ordering. You will need to <a href="/ossm/Hardware/motor/programming">program the motor</a> before first use.
</Note>

## Comparison with 57AIM30 Gold Motor

### Advantages

| Feature | Benefit |
|---|---|
| Smaller diameter (42 mm vs 57 mm) | ~26% reduction enables tighter clearances |
| Cylindrical shape | Easier to package in round or narrow enclosures |
| Lower mass (no external heatsink) | Potentially lighter overall; exact weight varies by vendor |

### Trade-offs

| Limitation | Impact |
|---|---|
| No mounting ears | Requires face-mounting into the motor front plate with precisely sized screws |
| Fewer off-the-shelf housings | Printed/aftermarket OSSM housings may not fit without modification |
| Reduced heat dissipation | Higher case temperatures at similar loads; plan active airflow or added mass |
| Not necessarily shorter | Overall length is often similar to the 57AIM30; do not assume a shorter stack-up |

<Warning>
If you are following an OSSM Bill of Materials, you must adjust your mount, fastener lengths, and printed parts for the 42 mm body. Validate fitment before purchasing all components.
</Warning>

## Mounting considerations

Face-mounting into the motor front plate is required. Because fasteners thread into the motor body, length and thread engagement are critical.

<Steps>
<Step title="Measure and plan clearances">
- Measure the motor face depth, pilot diameter, and the depth of each threaded hole.
- Confirm shaft diameter, flat location, and stick-out to ensure pulley/coupler alignment.

<Check>
You should have a drawing or notes with: pilot Ø, bolt circle, hole size/thread, hole depth, shaft Ø and length, and required standoff thickness.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Select hardware and adapter">
- Choose the correct thread size and pitch for the face holes (verify on your unit; do not assume).
- Use an adapter plate or printed cradle sized for a 42 mm body if your current mount expects 57 mm.
- Start with temporary standoffs/spacers so you can fine-tune pulley alignment before final assembly.

<Tip>
If you already have a 57 mm mount, a simple reducer ring or adapter plate can bridge 57 mm mounting to a 42 mm motor while preserving shaft center height.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Install with correct fastener length">
- Target 1–1.5× diameter of thread engagement, without bottoming out in the blind holes.
- Apply medium-strength threadlocker and torque evenly in a cross pattern to avoid misalignment.

<Warning>
Overlong screws can contact internal windings or the rotor and permanently damage the motor. Always verify hole depth and use a physical stop or washers during first fit.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Align and verify motion">
- With power off, rotate the shaft by hand to confirm there is no rubbing.
- Power on and run at low speed, observing for vibration, axial wobble, or noise.

<Check>
No rubbing, the shaft runs true, and the coupler/pulley is aligned with the driven axis.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Thermal performance

Without the external heatsink, the 42AIM30 has less surface area for cooling. When enclosed in a 3D-printed housing or run at high load:

- Provide airflow (vents, fan, or open-frame mounting) around the motor can.
- Add thermal mass (e.g., a clamp-on aluminum ring or metal adapter plate) to spread heat.
- Avoid fully encapsulating the motor in plastic; leave clearance around the can.
- Reduce duty cycle or speed if the case becomes uncomfortably hot to the touch.

<Info>
Thermal behavior depends on load, ambient temperature, enclosure geometry, and airflow. Capture your own case-temperature data during a 10–15 minute representative run and adjust cooling accordingly.
</Info>

## Electrical compatibility

- Power and signal wiring follow the same process as the Gold Motor. Use /open-source-sex-machine/ossm-electronics/wiring-your-gold-motor
- Ensure your power budget aligns with the OSSM PCB capabilities in /open-source-sex-machine/ossm-electronics/ossm-pcb-spec-sheet
- If your 42AIM30 uses a different base connector or pinout, you will need a compatible harness or adapter; confirm before powering on.

## Bill of Materials (BOM) impact

Expect changes to:

- Motor mount: adapter plate or 42 mm-specific bracket/cradle
- Fasteners: different lengths and possibly thread sizes for face-mounting
- Printed parts: resized shells or reducers to locate the 42 mm body
- Cooling: small fan, vented panels, or an aluminum clamp ring for heat spreading

<Tip>
If you do not have tight space constraints, the 57AIM30 Gold Motor remains the easiest option due to ready-made mounts and better passive cooling.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="The motor runs hot in my enclosure">
- Increase ventilation or add a small 24V fan aimed across the motor can
- Add a metal adapter plate or clamp ring to increase heat capacity
- Reduce speed/duty cycle or provide rest intervals during long sessions
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I can't get the mounting screws to seat correctly">
- Re-check thread size/pitch and hole depth on the motor
- Test-fit with progressively longer screws to confirm engagement without bottoming out
- Shim the adapter plate to maintain shaft center height and coupler alignment
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The pulley/coupler is misaligned after the swap">
- Use spacers or reposition the motor so the shaft centerline matches the original setup
- Loosen, realign, and re-torque in a cross pattern; re-verify free rotation by hand
