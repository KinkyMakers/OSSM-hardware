title: "iHSV57 Legacy Motor"
description: "Pre-2024 recommended motor option, now superseded by the Gold Motor"
---

The iHSV57 series was the original recommended motor for OSSM builds before 2024.

<Warning>
This motor is no longer recommended for new builds. Use the [57AIM30 Gold Motor](/ossm/Hardware/motor/standard-build-motor) instead.
</Warning>

## Why the iHSV57 is No Longer Recommended

The 57AIM30 Gold Motor replaced the iHSV57 as the standard build motor due to several significant improvements:

| Factor | iHSV57 | 57AIM30 Gold Motor |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Length | 100% (baseline) | 40% shorter |
| Weight | 100% (baseline) | 50% lighter |
| Peak force | 100% (baseline) | 30% higher |
| Cost | 100% (baseline) | ~20% cheaper |
| Over-torque handling | Motor disables | Configurable torque reduction |

## Existing iHSV57 Builds

If you have an existing OSSM with an iHSV57 motor:

<Note>
Your build remains fully functional. The iHSV57 is a capable motor—you do not need to upgrade unless you want the benefits of the Gold Motor.
</Note>

### Upgrading to Gold Motor

The 57AIM30 Gold Motor is a drop-in replacement for the iHSV57:

- Same NEMA23 mounting pattern
- Same shaft diameter
- Compatible with existing actuator hardware

<Info>
If upgrading from iHSV57 to Gold Motor, you may need to add a 1500µF capacitor (minimum 50V) to PCB versions older than V2.3 to handle regenerative braking.
</Info>

## Programming Requirements

Like all OSSM motors, the iHSV57 requires programming to set the steps per revolution to 800. Refer to the [motor programming guide](/ossm/Hardware/motor/programming) for instructions.
