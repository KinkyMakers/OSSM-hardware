description: "The 57AIM30 Gold Motor is the recommended motor for all new OSSM builds"
---

The **57AIM30 Gold Motor** is the current standard motor for OSSM builds, offering the best combination of performance, size, and cost.

<Card title="Purchase Gold Motor" icon="cart-shopping" href="https://www.researchanddesire.com/products/ossm-motor-gold-motor">
Available pre-programmed from Research and Desire, ready to use with your OSSM.

## Why the Gold Motor?

The 57AIM30 replaced the legacy iHSV57 motor as the build standard due to significant improvements across all key metrics:

| Improvement | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| 60% shorter | More compact builds, easier mounting |
| 50% lighter | Reduced overall weight |
| 30% higher peak force | Better performance under load |
| ~20% cheaper | Lower build cost |
| Better over-torque handling | Configurable torque reduction vs hard disable |
| Drop-in replacement | Compatible with existing NEMA23 hardware |

## Sourcing Your Motor

### From Research and Desire (Recommended)

Motors from [Research and Desire](https://www.researchanddesire.com/products/ossm-motor-gold-motor) are:

- Pre-programmed for OSSM
- Tested and verified
- Ready to install

<Check>
No additional programming required when purchasing from R&D.
</Check>

### From Other Suppliers

If sourcing a generic 57AIM30, verify these specifications:

| Specification | Required Value |
|--------------|----------------|
| Speed rating | 1500 RPM |
| Interface | RS485 |
| Model | 57AIM30 |

<Warning>
Do **not** purchase the 3000 RPM or CANBUS versions—these are incompatible with OSSM.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Avoid the 60AIM motor.** The 60AIM has a larger NEMA24 (60 mm) frame size that does not fit the standard OSSM printed parts, which are designed for NEMA23 (57 mm) motors. Using a 60AIM requires custom mounting hardware and modifications to the actuator housing.
</Warning>

<Note>
Motors from third-party suppliers require programming before use. See the [programming guide](/ossm/Hardware/motor/programming) for instructions.
</Note>

## PCB Compatibility

The Gold Motor's improved efficiency generates more regenerative power during certain motion conditions, requiring additional capacitance on the PCB.

| PCB Version | Compatibility |
|-------------|---------------|
| V2.3 or newer | Fully compatible, capacitor included |
| V2.2 | Compatible with simple PH-4 cable wiring |
| Older than V2.2 | Requires soldering wires to 10-pin header |

<Warning>
If using a PCB older than V2.3, add a **1500µF capacitor (minimum 50V)** to handle regenerative braking. Without this capacitor, voltage spikes may damage your electronics.
</Warning>

## Technical Specifications

### Advantages

- **Compact size**: 40% of the length of the 180W standard motor
- **Lightweight**: 50% of the weight of the 180W motor
- **High performance**: 30% higher peak force in real-world testing
- **Configurable protection**: Reduces torque output instead of disabling on overload
- **Hardware compatible**: Same mounting pattern and shaft diameter as iHSV57

### Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Regenerative power handling">
The motor's efficiency means it generates more power during deceleration. PCB V2.3 includes the necessary capacitor; older boards require manual addition.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="RS485 communication">
The Gold Motor uses RS485 digital communication. This is handled by the OSSM PCB V2.2 and newer—no user configuration needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Software configuration">
Default firmware settings work for most users. Advanced users can tune motor behavior through the programming tool, but incorrect settings may cause the motor to disable under torque.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Speed limits">
The Gold Motor's maximum speed exceeds the OSSM software's default speed limit. Standard users won't notice any difference; only custom firmware modifications might encounter this limit.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Motor Programming

<Info>
Motors must be programmed to set steps per revolution to **800** for OSSM compatibility.
</Info>

- **R&D motors**: Pre-programmed, no action needed
- **Third-party motors**: Require programming via USB to RS485 adapter

## Software Compatibility

The OSSM firmware supports closed-loop servo motors and is tested with:

- 57AIM30 (Gold Motor) — **Recommended**
- 42AIM30 (Round Motor variant)
- iHSV57 (Legacy motor)

<Note>
All supported motors use the NEMA23 form factor. Using stepper motors or other motor types requires custom hardware design and advanced firmware modifications.
</Note>

## Alternative Motors

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="42AIM30 Round Motor" icon="circle" href="/ossm/Hardware/motor/alternatives/42AIM30">
Compact variant with smaller diameter but limited mounting options.
</Card>

<Card title="iHSV57 Legacy Motor" icon="clock-rotate-left" href="/ossm/Hardware/motor/alternatives/iHSV57">
Pre-2024 standard motor, still functional but no longer recommended for new builds.
