<GoldMotorControl />

Program your Gold Motor (AIM series) for OSSM before first use. You will set steps per revolution and the communication parameters used by the OSSM Reference Board.

<Note>
Motors purchased from Research and Desire come pre-programmed. Only follow this guide if you sourced your motor elsewhere or need to restore defaults.
</Note>

## Web-based programming tool

Use the browser tool to read and write motor settings.

<Card title="Gold Motor Programming Tool" icon="microchip" href="https://armpitmfg.com/ossm/gmp/">
Program your motor directly from Chrome, Edge, or other Chromium-based browsers using the Web Serial API.
</Card>

<Tip>
- The Web Serial API is supported in Chromium-based browsers on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is not available in Safari or Firefox.
- Some USB–RS485 adapters require drivers (e.g., FTDI/CP210x/CH340). Install the vendor driver if your adapter is not detected by the OS.
</Tip>

## Prerequisites

Gather the following before you start:

- RS485 to USB adapter with 5V+, GND, A, and B pins (for example, a terminal-block style adapter)
- 20–36 V DC power supply for the motor
- Chromium-based desktop browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)
- Access to the OSSM Reference Board (for power and the signal cable you will temporarily disconnect)

<Warning>
Never power the motor from USB alone. The motor must have its normal 20–36 V DC input during programming.
</Warning>

## Programming instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Disconnect the signal cable">
Remove the OSSM Reference Board 4‑pin signal plug from the motor.

<Warning>
Leave the signal cable disconnected during programming. Having both the RS485 adapter and the OSSM board connected can cause bus conflicts and failed writes.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect the RS485 adapter">
Wire the RS485 USB adapter to the motor programming port:

| Adapter pin | Motor pin |
|-------------|-----------|
| A | A |
| B | B |
| 5V+ | 5V+ |
| GND | GND |

<Tip>
Adapter labeling is not always consistent. If the tool cannot detect the motor, swap A and B on the adapter and try again.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Power the motor">
Provide 20–36 V DC to the motor using either:

- The OSSM Reference Board (recommended for convenience), or
- An external bench supply

<Check>
Confirm the green LED on the rear of the servo is lit to verify power.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Open and connect the programming tool">
1. Open the Gold Motor Programming Tool in your browser.
2. Select **Connect to Motor**.
3. Choose your USB serial device from the dialog and grant access.

The tool will read and display the current motor settings.
</Step>

<Step title="Review and configure settings">
Adjust only what you need for OSSM:

- Basic settings are surfaced by default and cover the typical OSSM configuration.
- Advanced settings are available but should be changed only if you understand their impact.

<Warning>
Incorrect advanced values can disable motion or make the motor appear unresponsive. Document original values before changing them.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Write settings and verify">
1. Select **Write Settings**.
2. Wait for the write sequence to complete. The tool writes critical values multiple times for reliability.
3. Power‑cycle the motor, reconnect, and select **Read Settings** to confirm persistence.

<Check>
All values should match your expected configuration after the power cycle.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Disconnect and reassemble">
1. Remove power from the motor.
2. Unplug the RS485 programming adapter.
3. Reconnect the OSSM 4‑pin signal cable.
4. Restore normal power and proceed with OSSM setup.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Default settings applied by the tool

The programming tools set the required OSSM defaults:

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Steps per revolution | 800 | Ensures correct motion scaling in OSSM |
| Communication protocol | RS485 | Matches the OSSM PCB interface |
| Over‑torque behavior | Reduce torque | Prevents abrupt motor disable under load |

<Info>
Depending on your motor and adapter, the tool may also configure bus parameters (baud rate and device address) to OSSM defaults. Use the **Read Settings** function to confirm.
</Info>

## Run the tool locally (offline)

You can use the tool offline if your environment blocks external sites.

<Steps>
<Step title="Get the tool files">
Download the `GMP` folder from the OSSM hardware repository and keep the folder structure intact on your computer.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the tool">
Open `index.html` from the `GMP` folder in a Chromium-based browser.
</Step>

<Step title="Program as usual">
Follow the same connection and programming steps described above.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Some browsers restrict file:// access to serial ports via Web Serial on managed devices. If you encounter an error, serve the folder over `http://` using a simple local server (for example, `python -m http.server`) and open the page from `http://localhost`.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Motor not detected">
- Confirm the RS485 adapter has power (some adapters require 5V from the motor’s programming header).
- Verify A connects to A and B connects to B. If labels are unclear, try swapping A/B at the adapter.
- Ensure the motor is powered and the green LED is on.
- Try a different USB port or cable.
- Install or update the USB–serial driver for your adapter chipset.
- Use a supported Chromium-based browser and grant serial permission when prompted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Programming fails or times out">
- Disconnect and reconnect the RS485 adapter, then retry.
- Power-cycle the motor and reconnect in the tool.
- Ensure the OSSM signal cable is disconnected during programming.
- Shorten the RS485 wiring run and avoid loose jumper connections.
- Remove other RS485 devices from the bus so only the motor and adapter are connected.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Settings don't persist after power cycle">
- Run **Write Settings** again and wait for confirmation.
- Power-cycle the motor, then use **Read Settings** to verify.
- If values still revert, check for firmware compatibility constraints and reapply defaults using the tool’s basic settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Adapter connects but reads garbage data">
- Install the correct driver for your adapter and reboot.
- Try another USB port (avoid unpowered hubs).
- Reduce electrical noise: route RS485 lines away from motor power leads.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Legacy Python script

<Info>
A command‑line Python script exists for advanced users. It is less maintained than the web tool and is intended for recovery or automation scenarios.
</Info>

The script writes OSSM default settings and prints the current configuration. You can find it in the OSSM hardware repository under the Gold Motor tools.

<Tip>
Test with the web tool first. Use the Python script only if you need headless or automated configuration.
</Tip>

## Safety and best practices

- Work with power removed whenever changing wiring.
- Do not short 5V+ to GND on the programming header.
- Keep RS485 leads short and firmly terminated. For long runs, a 120 Ω terminator may improve signal integrity.
- Record original values before making changes, and save a screenshot of the final configuration for future reference.

<Check>
After successful programming and reconnection to OSSM, jog the motor in your control software to verify direction, scaling, and smooth motion.
