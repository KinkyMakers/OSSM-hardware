Before using your motor with OSSM, you must program it to set the correct steps per revolution and communication parameters.

<Note>
Motors purchased from Research and Desire come pre-programmed. You only need to follow this guide if you sourced your motor elsewhere.
</Note>

## Web-Based Programming Tool

The easiest way to program your Gold Motor is the browser-based tool:

<Card title="Gold Motor Programming Tool" icon="microchip" href="https://armpitmfg.com/ossm/gmp/">
Program your motor directly from Chrome, Edge, or other Chromium-based browsers using the Web Serial API.
</Card>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, gather the following:

- **RS485 to USB adapter** with 5V+, GND, A, and B pins ([example adapter](https://www.amazon.com/CERRXIAN-Terminal-Converter-Serial-Windows/dp/B09JMT9D59))
- **20-36V DC power supply** for the motor
- **Chromium-based browser** (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)

## Programming Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Disconnect the signal cable">
Remove the OSSM Reference Board 4-pin signal plug from the motor.

<Warning>
The signal cable must be disconnected during programming. Leaving it connected can cause communication conflicts and programming failures.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect the RS485 adapter">
Wire the RS485 USB adapter to the motor programming port:

| Adapter Pin | Motor Pin |
|-------------|-----------|
| A | A |
| B | B |
| 5V+ | 5V+ |
| GND | GND |

<Tip>
If you don't have the matching plug for the AIM series motor programming port, you can use individual jumper wires to make the connections.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Power the motor">
Supply 20-36V DC power to the motor through either:
- The OSSM Reference Board
- An external power supply

<Check>
Verify the green LED on the rear of the servo illuminates, confirming power is connected.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect to the programming tool">
1. Open the [Gold Motor Programming Tool](https://armpitmfg.com/ossm/gmp/) in your browser
2. Click **Connect to Motor**
3. Select your USB serial port from the browser dialog

The tool reads and displays the current motor settings.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure motor settings">
Review and adjust the settings as needed:

- **Basic settings** are displayed by default and are sufficient for most OSSM builds
- **Advanced settings** can be revealed but require caution

<Warning>
Incorrect advanced settings can make the motor unusable. Only modify advanced settings if you understand their function.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Write settings to motor">
1. Click **Write Settings** to program the motor
2. The tool writes settings multiple times to ensure reliability
3. Verify the updated values display correctly

<Check>
Confirm all settings match your expected configuration before proceeding.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Disconnect and reassemble">
1. Remove power from the motor
2. Disconnect the RS485 programming adapter
3. Reconnect the OSSM signal cable
</Step>
</Steps>

## Running the Tool Locally

You can run the programming tool offline:

1. Download the `GMP` folder from the [OSSM hardware repository](https://github.com/KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware/tree/master/Hardware/Servo%20Tools/Gold%20Motor)
2. Open `index.html` in a Chromium-based browser
3. Follow the same connection and programming steps

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Motor not detected">
- Verify the RS485 adapter is properly connected
- Check that A connects to A and B connects to B (not crossed)
- Ensure the motor has power (green LED visible)
- Try a different USB port
- Confirm your browser supports Web Serial API
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Programming fails or times out">
- Disconnect and reconnect the RS485 adapter
- Power cycle the motor
- Ensure the OSSM signal cable is disconnected
- Try reducing the distance between adapter and motor
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Settings don't persist after power cycle">
- Re-run the write operation
- Verify the tool shows success after writing
- Check for firmware compatibility issues
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Legacy Python Script

<Info>
A Python-based programming script is available for advanced users who prefer command-line tools. This script is less maintained than the web tool.
</Info>

The Python script writes default settings to the Gold Motor and displays current configuration. Find it in the [OSSM hardware repository](https://github.com/KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware/tree/master/Hardware/Servo%20Tools/Gold%20Motor).

### Default Settings Changed

The programming tools configure these essential settings:

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Steps per revolution | 800 | Required for OSSM motion control |
| Communication protocol | RS485 | Matches OSSM PCB interface |
| Over-torque behavior | Reduce torque | Prevents sudden motor disable |
