## Function

The Upper + Handle Print-In-Place is a combined part that simplifies assembly. This component:

- Combines the Upper V1.1 base section with the integrated handle
- Prints as a single piece with a hinge that releases after printing
- Eliminates the need for one M4x12/M4x10 bolt and one M4 Hex Nut
- Provides the clamping action that secures the motor ring

<Note>
This is a non-standard part. Use this variant if your printer is well-calibrated with optimal layer adhesion.
</Note>

<Tip>
The print-in-place hinge will break free when you flex the part after removing it from the build plate. Don't force it—gentle flexing should release the hinge cleanly.
</Tip>

## Print Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Walls | 6 |
| Infill Type | Cross Hatch or Gyroid |
| Infill Percentage | 10% |
| Supports | Tree Supports, 5° threshold angle |

<Warning>
Print this part in the default file orientation. The print-in-place hinge requires precise layer adhesion to function correctly.
</Warning>
