## Function

The PitClamp Mini Lower is the foundation of the quick-release mounting system. This component:

- Mounts directly to the 3030 or 4040 aluminum extrusion using M6 T-nuts
- Features 64mm M6 hole spacing for secure extrusion attachment
- Provides the lower hinge point for the clamping mechanism
- Accepts the dogbone latch components for tool-free motor release

<Warning>
Print this part in the default file orientation. Printing base components in other orientations causes structural weakness.
</Warning>
