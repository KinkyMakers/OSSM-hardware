## Function

The Dogbone Nuts are part of the quick-release latch mechanism. This component:

- Forms the nut-side of the dogbone latch pair
- Receives the Dogbone Bolts to secure the clamp
- Enables tool-free motor release and attachment
- Provides the locking detent for the 4-degree rotation adjustment

The dogbone latch system allows you to remove the motor from the mount for storage or transfer it to another base without tools.
