## Overview

The Dogbone Nuts are the nut-side of the PitClamp Mini quick‑release latch. Together with the Dogbone Bolts, they let you:

- Attach or remove the OSSM motor from a PitClamp Mini base without tools
- Secure the clamp under load while maintaining consistent alignment
- Index rotation in 4° steps via a built‑in detent profile

<Info>
This part is designed specifically for the PitClamp Mini system. Use it only with the matching Dogbone Bolts and PitClamp Mini base components.
</Info>

## What you need

- 3D printer capable of printing PETG, ASA, ABS, or Nylon
- Slicer profile that supports tree supports or equivalent
- Matching PitClamp Mini components (Dogbone Bolts and base)

<Tip>
Print at least one spare set so you can swap quickly if a part wears during heavy use.
</Tip>

## Print guidelines

- Quantity: 2 pieces (one left, one right) unless your assembly requires additional latch points
- Orientation: Flat face down; detent features facing up for cleaner indexing
- Nozzle: 0.4 mm (0.6 mm acceptable for stronger parts)
- Layer height: 0.20 mm (0.24–0.28 mm for faster prints)
- Perimeters (walls): 6
- Top/bottom layers: 6 / 6
- Infill: 10% Gyroid or Crosshatch
- Supports: Tree supports with 5° threshold angle (support interface recommended)
- Material: PETG or ASA recommended; ABS or Nylon for maximum heat and wear resistance

<Warning>
Avoid PLA for load‑bearing latch parts. PLA can creep and crack under clamp loads and elevated temperatures.
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="PrusaSlicer / SuperSlicer">
- Infill: Gyroid 10%

- XY compensation: start at 0.00 mm; adjust ±0.05–0.10 mm if fit is too tight/loose
</Tab>

<Tab title="Cura">
- Infill: Gyroid 10%

<Tab title="Bambu Studio">

- Support Type: Tree; Angle 5°; Support Interface: On
- Hole/Contour compensation: 0.00 mm baseline; adjust ±0.05–0.10 mm as needed
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
For the best‑feeling detents, prioritize clean top surfaces: reduce print speed for the top layers and enable ironing only on top surfaces if your slicer supports it.
</Note>

## Post‑processing

- Remove supports carefully from the detent pockets.
- Deburr with a light pass of a deburring tool or fine file. Do not round over the detent edges—crisp edges improve the 4° indexing feel.
- Optional: Dry‑fit and, if engagement is too tight, adjust slicer horizontal expansion by −0.05 mm and reprint.

## Installation and fit‑check

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare the base and bolts">
Ensure the PitClamp Mini base is installed and the matching Dogbone Bolts are printed and free of defects.
</Step>

<Step title="Seat the Dogbone Nuts">
Place each Dogbone Nut into its pocket on the base with the detent features oriented to face the bolt’s mating profile.
</Step>

<Step title="Engage the latch">
Insert the Dogbone Bolt through the clamp and rotate into the Dogbone Nut until you feel the detent click. Hand‑tighten to the normal clamping force.

<Check>
You should feel distinct 4° “clicks” as you rotate, and the clamp should not back‑off under light manual load.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify clearance and alignment">
Cycle the latch several times. Confirm no rubbing on adjacent printed parts and that the motor releases and re‑attaches smoothly.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Latch feels gritty or inconsistent">
- Clean support residue from detent features
- Increase top layers to 8 and reprint for smoother detents
- Reduce print speed for top layers by 20%
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fit is too tight / won’t rotate">
- Reduce horizontal expansion (XY compensation) by 0.05–0.10 mm and reprint
- Verify support interface didn’t scar the mating surface; lightly deburr
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fit is too loose / won’t hold clamp force">
- Increase horizontal expansion by 0.05–0.10 mm and reprint
- Increase perimeters to 7–8 for stiffer walls
- Consider stiffer material (ASA/ABS/Nylon)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Premature wear of detents">
- Print with higher‑temperature material (ASA/ABS/Nylon)
- Increase infill to 20% and perimeters to 8
- Ensure detents are printed facing up for best surface quality
</Accordion>

<Warning>
Inspect printed latch parts regularly. Replace immediately if you see cracking, layer separation, or rounded detents that reduce holding strength.
