<Update label="v1.1" description="April 2, 2025">
## Improvements

- Pivot bolt changed from M6x20 to M5x20 for a slimmer, easier-to-source fastener
- Lower Dogbone grip slightly loosened to simplify assembly while maintaining secure clamping

<Warning>
If you are updating an older build, adjust your BOM and spares to use an **M5x20** pivot bolt. Mixing M6/M5 hardware between versions can cause fit issues.
</Warning>

<Update label="v1.1 Ring" description="November 22, 2024">
## New Ring Design

Added v1.1 57AIM Ring with improved mounting features. This is now the recommended default ring for 57AIM motors and supports the Gold Motor covers.

<Tip>
If you currently use an earlier 57AIM ring, upgrade to the v1.1 ring to improve mounting and compatibility.

<Update label="File Restructure" description="September 8, 2024">
## Organization Updates

- Refactored file structure for clearer organization
- Updated default files to simplify the bill of materials (BOM)
</Update>

<Update label="Helper Brim" description="September 4, 2024">
## Print Improvements

Added **Standard Base w/ Helper Brim** STEP file to the Files folder. This helps prevent the latch corner from lifting during printing.

<Tip>
Use the helper brim variant if you see corner lift or latch distortion on FDM prints.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Experimental component: verify cable clearance and strain relief before extended use.
</Warning>
</Update>

<Update label="Print-In-Place" description="August 28, 2024">
## Reduced Hardware Option

- Added **Print-In-Place PitClamp Mini** to the Experimental folder (reduces required hardware)
- Revised **Extrusion Ring** from Normal to Experimental status pending a stronger redesign

<Info>
Print-in-place designs trade adjustability for fewer fasteners. Confirm fit and smooth motion before loading.
