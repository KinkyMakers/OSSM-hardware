---

Get up and running quickly with short, focused videos for the PitClamp Mini. Each section includes what you need, safety notes, and verification steps so you can confirm a correct build before moving on.

<Info>
PitClamp Mini v1.1 adds ring compatibility for "Gold Motor" covers used on 57AIM30 motors and supports 360° rotation for flexible mounting.
</Info>

<Tip>
Watch each video all the way through once, then follow it again while building. Lay out your parts and hardware before you start.
</Tip>

## Before you begin

- Tools: metric hex key set, small flat‑head screwdriver, side cutters or deburring tool, and optional medium‑strength threadlocker.
- Materials: your PitClamp Mini v1.1 printed parts and hardware.
- Kit contents (typical): base with handle, motor ring, non‑pivot actuator middle body, and a hardware pack with M4/M5/M6 fasteners and T‑nuts for 3030 extrusion.

<Warning>
Disconnect power and keep fingers clear of pinch points while tightening the clamp and rings. Do not overtighten—snug plus a quarter‑turn is usually sufficient.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Which actuator middle body should I use?**

The PitClamp Mini kit includes a non‑pivot actuator middle body (the smaller middle body, bagged with the other PitClamp components). Use this part instead of the standard middle body or middle pivot body from your OSSM actuator kit.

Why? The PitClamp Mini has its own integrated pivot mechanism for angle adjustment, so the middle pivot body's functionality would be redundant.
</Info>

## Body assembly

Assemble the main PitClamp Mini body components (base, upper/lower halves, and handle).

<Steps>
<Step title="Dry‑fit and prep">
Confirm the printed parts fit together without force. Lightly deburr any nibs or elephant’s foot on mating surfaces.

<Check>
Parts sit flush with no rocking or gaps once hand‑pressed together.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Assemble the clamp body">
Join the base and handle halves, insert the M4/M5 fasteners where shown in the video, and seat the nuts fully in their pockets.

<Check>
All nuts are fully captured; screws turn freely by hand for the first few threads.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Mount to extrusion (optional)">
If you’re mounting to 3030 extrusion, slide T‑nuts into the slot, position the clamp, and tighten gradually while keeping the body square.

<Check>
Clamp holds position under hand force and does not slide when pushed.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## 57AIM ring installation

Install the ring for 57AIM‑series motors (including the 57AIM30 “Gold Motor”).

<Steps>
<Step title="Orient the ring">
Align the ring so cable exits and mounting holes match your preferred orientation.

<Tip>
Plan cable strain relief before tightening to avoid rubbing during motion.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Seat and fasten">
Place the ring around the motor can and insert the M5 screws and nuts. Tighten in a cross pattern in small increments.

<Check>
Gap around the ring is uniform; the motor does not shift when gently twisted by hand.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Attach to the clamp body">
Bolt the ringed motor to the PitClamp body. Tighten until secure while keeping the actuator aligned.

<Check>
The actuator cycles smoothly by hand with no binding or cable snagging.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## iHSV57 ring post‑processing

The iHSV57 ring prints as one piece and requires post‑processing to separate into two halves and assemble around the motor.

<Steps>
<Step title="Identify the split">
Locate the designed separation seam shown in the video. Score lightly along the seam if needed.

<Warning>
Use a sharp blade away from your body. Wear cut‑resistant gloves when scoring or prying prints.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Separate and clean up">
Gently split the halves, then remove stringing or bumps. Test‑fit around the motor to confirm clearance.

<Check>
Halves seat fully with even contact and can be held closed by hand without gaps.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Install on motor and tighten">
Wrap the ring around the iHSV57 motor, insert hardware, and tighten evenly in a cross pattern.

<Check>
No rubbing against the motor can; rotation remains free and cables have strain relief.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Troubleshooting: clamp slips on extrusion">
- Ensure T‑nuts are correctly oriented and fully engaged in the 3030 slot.
- Tighten both clamp screws a little at a time while keeping the body square.
- Clean dust or lubricant from the extrusion where the clamp mounts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Troubleshooting: ring misalignment or wobble">
- Loosen slightly and re‑tighten in a cross pattern to center the ring.
- Verify all nuts are seated. Replace any stripped fasteners.
- Check printed surfaces for debris preventing full contact; lightly deburr if needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Noise or binding during motion">
- Re‑route cables to avoid contact with moving parts.
- Check that the ring is not overtightened causing distortion.
- Confirm the actuator and mount are co‑planar before final torque.
</Accordion>
