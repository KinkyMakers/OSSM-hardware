The OSSM wired remote control provides a compact, handheld interface for your machine. This page shows exactly what to print, the slicer settings to use, and the minimal hardware required to assemble the wired remote enclosure.

## Printed parts

Print the following components:

| Part (STL name) | Quantity |
|---|---|
| Remote Body (OSSM-Remote-Body) | 1 |
| Top Cover (OSSM-Remote-Cover) | 1 |
| Rotary Knob (OSSM-Remote-Rotary Knobs) | 2 |

<Tip>
Prefer a different look? Alternate knob styles are available in the “Non-standard” folder of the source repository. Print any two compatible knob variants.
</Tip>

## Recommended print settings

Use these settings for all enclosure parts unless otherwise noted:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Nozzle | 0.4 mm |
| Layer height | 0.20 mm (0.28 mm draft acceptable) |
| Walls | 3 |
| Top/bottom layers | 4–5 |
| Infill | 25% Gyroid or Crosshatch |
| Supports | Yes — Auto (cover off, internal cavities clear) |
| Material | PLA+ or PETG |
| Bed adhesion | Skirt; add a small brim for knobs if your bed adhesion is weak |

<Note>
Estimated filament usage for all parts is approximately <strong>70 g</strong>.
</Note>

<Tip>
Orientation recommendations:
- Body: Flat face down so the encoder holes point up. This keeps the front surface clean and strong around the controls.
- Top Cover: Flat face down.
- Knobs: Print face down for best surface finish on the top.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Dry-fit before final assembly. If bolt holes feel tight due to printer tolerances, chase them with a 4.0 mm drill bit by hand rather than over-tightening fasteners.
</Warning>

## Bill of materials (enclosure)

| Item | Quantity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| M4 button cap bolt, 6–8 mm length | 2 | Secures top cover to body. Choose length based on fit; 8 mm is commonly used.

<Info>
If you purchased the “OSSM Remote PCB Only,” it typically ships with a 7 ft CAT6 cable and two M4×8 mm fasteners you can use for this enclosure. If you received a different length, use any two M4 button cap bolts between 6–8 mm that do not bottom out when the cover is installed.

## Assembly overview

<Steps>
<Step title="Print and prep the parts">
Slice and print the body, cover, and two knobs using the settings above. Remove supports and lightly deburr holes.

<Check>
The cover sits flush on the body and bolts pass through the cover freely by hand.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Test fit the electronics (dry fit)">
Place your remote PCB into the body to check clearance around the encoder shafts and cable exit. Adjust any stringing or bumps so the PCB seats flat.

<Tip>
If a knob rubs the cover after assembly, add a 0.2–0.3 mm Z-offset shim under the encoder or lightly sand the underside of the knob.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Install the knobs">
Press-fit the printed knobs onto the encoder shafts. They should be snug but not require force that might stress the PCB.

<Warning>
If the fit is too tight, do not force it. Warm the knob slightly with your hands, or scale it to 100.5–101% and reprint.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Close the enclosure">
Place the top cover, align holes, and fasten with two M4 button cap bolts (6–8 mm). Do not overtighten.

<Check>
Knobs rotate freely without scraping, and the cover sits flush with no gaps.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Bolts bottom out before the cover is tight">
Use 6 mm bolts instead of 8 mm, or add a thin washer under each head.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Knobs scrape the cover">
Check that the PCB is fully seated in the body. Add a thin shim under the PCB standoffs or lightly sand the underside of the knobs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Holes too tight for M4 hardware">
Lightly ream with a 4.0 mm drill bit by hand. Do not use a power drill inside the enclosure.
</Accordion>
