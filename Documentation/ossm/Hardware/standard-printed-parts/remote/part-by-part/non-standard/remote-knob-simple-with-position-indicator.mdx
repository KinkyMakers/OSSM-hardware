## Function

The Simple Knob with Position Indicator adds visual feedback to the minimalist design. This component:

- Press-fits onto the rotary encoder shafts
- Features a clean, simple profile with a position marker
- The indicator line shows the current knob rotation position
- Helps you visually track settings at a glance
- Two knobs are required per remote (one for each encoder)

<Note>
This is a non-standard part. The default build uses the Rounded Knob instead.
