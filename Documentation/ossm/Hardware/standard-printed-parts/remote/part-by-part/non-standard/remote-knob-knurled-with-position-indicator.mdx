## Function

The Knurled Knob with Position Indicator combines grip texture with visual feedback. This component:

- Press-fits onto the rotary encoder shafts
- Features a knurled (diamond pattern) texture for improved grip
- Includes a position indicator line to show current rotation
- Provides both tactile and visual feedback during adjustment
- Two knobs are required per remote (one for each encoder)

<Note>
This is a non-standard part. The default build uses the Rounded Knob instead.
