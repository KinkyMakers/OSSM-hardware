## Function

The Knurled Knob provides enhanced grip texture for the remote control. This component:

- Press-fits onto the rotary encoder shafts
- Features a knurled (diamond pattern) texture for improved grip
- Provides excellent tactile feedback during adjustment
- Ideal for situations where extra grip is needed
- Two knobs are required per remote (one for each encoder)

<Note>
This is a non-standard part. The default build uses the Rounded Knob instead.
