## Overview

The Rounded Knob is the default, ergonomic press-fit knob for the wired OSSM remote’s rotary encoders. You print two per remote and press them onto the encoder shafts for precise, comfortable control.

<Info>
Encoder functions can vary by firmware and device (wired vs. wireless). For an overview of current knob behavior on the wireless RADR remote, see <a href="/research-and-desire-remote/quick-start">Wireless Remote: Quick Start</a>.
</Info>

## Features

- Smooth, rounded profile for comfortable, non-slip fingertip control
- Positive, tactile feel for fine speed and stroke adjustments
- Designed to press-fit onto the wired remote’s rotary encoder shafts
- Two knobs required per remote (one per encoder)

<Tip>
Prefer a different feel? Alternate knob shapes are available in the project’s “Non-standard” designs (e.g., knurled or tall profiles).
</Tip>

## Print settings

- Material: PLA or PETG (PETG recommended for durability)
- Nozzle: 0.4 mm
- Layer height: 0.2 mm
- Walls (perimeters): 3
- Top/bottom: 4–5 layers
- Infill: 25% (Gyroid or Crosshatch)
- Supports: Yes (Auto)
- Adhesion: Brim optional (2–4 mm) for small-part stability
- Orientation: Print with the shaft cavity facing upward for best surface quality inside the bore

<Tip>
If your printer runs tight on press-fit features, reduce horizontal expansion (elephant foot compensation) or scale X/Y by −0.5% before slicing.
</Tip>

## Install

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare the part">
  Remove supports and lightly deburr the bore with a hobby knife or small round file.

  <Check>
  The bore is clean and smooth; no support nubs remain inside.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Test fit on the encoder shaft">
  Align the knob with the encoder shaft. Do not force it—ensure alignment first.

  <Warning>
  Excessive force can damage the encoder. Apply steady, straight pressure only.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Press-fit the knob">
  Press straight down until fully seated and flush with the encoder bushing. Repeat for the second encoder.

  <Check>
  Knobs rotate smoothly and the remote registers encoder turns and clicks.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Fit is too tight">
- Lightly ream the bore with a 6–6.5 mm round file or deburring tool.
- Re-slice with −0.5% to −1% XY scale or use a negative horizontal expansion value.
- Warm the knob slightly (hair dryer) and press-fit while warm.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fit is too loose">
- Re-slice with +0.5% to +1% XY scale.
- Add a thin wrap of PTFE/plumber’s tape to the shaft as a temporary shim.
- Use a tiny drop of removable (blue) threadlocker—keep it off the encoder body.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Support marks inside the bore">
- Increase support Z‑distance/interface layers.
- Switch to tree supports or reduce support density.
- Orient with the bore up to minimize internal supports.
