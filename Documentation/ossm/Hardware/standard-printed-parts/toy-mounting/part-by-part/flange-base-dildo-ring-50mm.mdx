## Function

The 50mm Dildo Ring provides secure toy mounting for 2-inch flange bases. This component:

- Accepts toys with approximately 2-inch (50mm) diameter flange bases
- Clamps around the toy flange for secure retention during operation
- Mounts to the 24mm threaded flange base adapter
- Suitable for smaller diameter flange-mount toys

<Tip>
Measure your toy's flange diameter before printing. If the flange is larger than 50mm, use the 63mm ring instead.
