## Function

The 63mm Dildo Ring provides secure toy mounting for 2.5-inch flange bases. This component:

- Accepts toys with approximately 2.5-inch (63mm) diameter flange bases
- Clamps around the toy flange for secure retention during operation
- Mounts to the 24mm threaded flange base adapter
- Suitable for larger diameter flange-mount toys

<Tip>
Measure your toy's flange diameter before printing. If the flange is smaller than 63mm, the 50mm ring may provide a tighter fit.
