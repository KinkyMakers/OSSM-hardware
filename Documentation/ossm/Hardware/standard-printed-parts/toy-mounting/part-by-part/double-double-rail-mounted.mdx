## Function

The Double Double Rail Mounted provides an alternative mounting approach. This component:

- Mounts directly to the MGN12H linear rail bearing block
- Bypasses the 24mm threaded interface entirely
- Provides mounting points facing both directions
- Offers a lower-profile mounting solution

<Note>
This mount requires different assembly than the 24mm threaded variants. It bolts directly to the rail carriage instead of using the threaded end effector.
