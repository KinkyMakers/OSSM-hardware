## Function

The 55mm Ring Insert sizes the SuCSOn mount for specific suction cup diameters. This component:

- Fits inside the SuCSOn Threaded Ring
- Provides a 55mm opening to match standard suction cup bases
- Secures the toy's suction cup for stable operation
- Can be swapped for different sizes as needed

<Note>
This is a non-standard part. Measure your toy's suction cup diameter to ensure compatibility with the 55mm insert.
