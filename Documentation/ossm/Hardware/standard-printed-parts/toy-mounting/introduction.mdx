<Info>
This page covers attaching toys and other end-effectors to your OSSM actuator. If you’re looking for how to mount the OSSM itself to a stand or surface, see <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/ossm-mounting">OSSM Mounting</a>.
</Info>

## What you’ll learn

- Which attachment methods work with OSSM
- When to use Vac-U-Lock vs. clamp vs. tie-on
- How to attach safely and verify a secure fit
- How to troubleshoot common mounting issues

## Prerequisites

- A fully assembled OSSM actuator and stand
- Your preferred toy(s)
- The appropriate end-effector from your kit

<Note>
Ready-to-Play kits include an end-effector set and ~3’ of paracord for tie-on mounting, plus an empty sandbag for stabilizing the stand. Fill the sandbag before play for best results.
</Note>

## Attachment options at a glance

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Vac-U-Lock" icon="bolt" href="#vac-u-lock">
  Industry-standard plug-and-socket system. Fast, secure, and ideal for toys designed for thrusting.
</Card>

<Card title="Harness-style clamp" icon="clamp" href="#clamp">
  Grips the base/neck of a wide range of toys. Great for toys without Vac-U-Lock compatibility.
</Card>

<Card title="Tie-on (paracord)" icon="link" href="#tie-on">
  Flexible, lightweight option using the included cord and tie points. Useful for unusual shapes.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Choose the attachment that matches the toy’s base: Vac‑U‑Lock socket → Vac‑U‑Lock plug; smooth flared base or solid neck → clamp; irregular shapes → tie-on.
</Tip>

## Vac-U-Lock mounting

Use this when your toy has a Vac‑U‑Lock–compatible socket.

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare the hardware">
  - Confirm your OSSM actuator is powered off.
  - Select the Vac‑U‑Lock end-effector from your kit and ensure the plug is clean and dry.

  <Warning>
  Avoid lubricating the plug itself—excess lube can reduce grip. Apply lube only where needed for play.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Seat the toy">
  - Align the toy’s socket with the plug.
  - Press straight on with steady, even pressure until it bottoms out.

  <Check>
  Tug test: pull firmly inline with the actuator. The toy should not detach or wobble.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify alignment and range">
  - Align the toy as straight as possible with the actuator to reduce side loading.
  - Manually move the carriage along a short stroke to confirm there is no binding.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Harness-style clamp mounting

Use this when your toy has a flared base or a solid neck the clamp can grip.

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare the clamp">
  - Power off the actuator.
  - Open the clamp and inspect the contact surfaces; ensure they are free of oils and debris.
</Step>

<Step title="Position and tighten">
  - Place the clamp just above the toy’s base (on the firmer neck if available).
  - Tighten evenly until the toy cannot twist or slide.

  <Warning>
  Do not overtighten on soft materials—compress only until secure to avoid permanent deformation.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Test security">
  - Perform a tug test inline with the stroke and a gentle twist test.
  - Start OSSM at low speed and short stroke to confirm stability, then increase as desired.

  <Check>
  If the toy shifts under low load, reposition the clamp lower on the neck or increase clamping force slightly.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
For very smooth toys, adding a thin, grippy barrier (for example, a soft cloth wrap) between the toy and clamp can improve holding power without over‑tightening.
</Tip>

## Tie-on (paracord) mounting

Use this for irregular shapes, suction‑cup bases, or when you want a lightweight connection with built‑in “give.”

<Steps>
<Step title="Plan your lashing points">
  - Identify two or more secure tie points on the end‑effector and a position on the toy where the cord will not slip off.
</Step>

<Step title="Attach and cinch">
  - Use opposing wraps to prevent rotation; finish with a locking knot (e.g., two half‑hitches).
  - Trim or tuck away excess cord to avoid entanglement.
</Step>

<Step title="Safety check">
  - Perform a tug test; the toy should not migrate under tension.
  - Run a short, slow stroke to verify that knots do not loosen.

  <Check>
  Re‑tighten after 1–2 minutes of motion—cord can settle on first use.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best‑practice checklist

- Start every session with a short, low‑speed test and watch for any slip or wobble.
- Keep all contact surfaces clean and dry before mounting; apply personal lubricant only after the toy is secured.
- Align the toy with the actuator’s stroke path; use your stand’s pivots to reduce side loads.
- Stabilize the base. Fill and place the included sandbag on the stand as needed.
- Inspect clamps, plugs, and cord for wear; replace if damaged.

<Warning>
Stop immediately if you feel unexpected resistance, hear unusual scraping or grinding, or see the toy migrating out of the mount. Re‑seat and re‑test before continuing.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="The toy slowly rotates or creeps out of the mount">
- Verify alignment with the actuator (minimize side loads).
- Clean the toy’s neck/base and the clamp pads; re‑tighten evenly.
- For Vac‑U‑Lock, re‑seat fully; avoid lube on the plug.
- For tie‑on, add an opposing wrap and re‑cinch.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Vibration or chatter at higher speeds">
- Shorten the stroke length slightly and increase speed gradually.
- Check that the stand is weighted and on a firm surface.
- Confirm the toy is centered and not flexing against the mount.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Angle feels off or causes binding">
- Adjust the stand’s pivot to keep the toy aligned with the stroke.
- Reposition the clamp lower on the toy’s neck to reduce leverage.
</Accordion>
