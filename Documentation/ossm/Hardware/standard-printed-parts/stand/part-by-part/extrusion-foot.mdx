## Function

The Extrusion Foot provides floor contact and protection. This component:

- Accepts adhesive non-slip furniture pads on the bottom surface
- Protects floors from the sharp aluminum extrusion edges
- Provides additional grip and stability during operation

You need **4 Extrusion Feet** per stand assembly.
