## Overview

The Extrusion Foot protects floors from the sharp edges of 3030 aluminum extrusion and improves stand stability. Each foot:

- Press-fits into the open ends of 3030 extrusion legs
- Provides a flat, wide contact patch for better grip
- Accepts adhesive non-slip pads on the bottom surface

<Info>
You need <strong>4 Extrusion Feet</strong> per stand assembly.
</Info>

## Compatibility

- Designed for 30 × 30 mm aluminum extrusion ("3030") with open ends
- Works with the OSSM Extrusion Stand/Base
- Press-fit tolerances vary by printer and filament; minor sanding or shimming may be required

## Print settings

Use these as a solid starting point. Adjust to your printer and filament.

| Setting | Recommended |
|---|---|
| Material | PETG or PLA+ (rigid, durable). TPU 95A optional for maximum grip (fit may change). |
| Nozzle | 0.4 mm |
| Layer height | 0.20 mm (0.28 mm acceptable for speed) |
| Walls/Perimeters | 6 |
| Top/Bottom layers | 6 (≈ 1.2 mm) |
| Infill type | Gyroid or Cross Hatch |
| Infill percentage | 25% |
| Supports | None |
| Adhesion | None or 2–4 mm brim if corners lift |
| Orientation | Flat pad face down on the build plate |

<Tip>
Prefer PETG for impact resistance and long-term durability. If printing in TPU for extra grip, reduce print speed and expect a tighter press-fit—test-fit before installing all four.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Adhesive pads can leave residue on some surfaces. Test on a scrap area first. Always verify the stand cannot slide on your specific floor before use.
</Warning>

## Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Print and clean">
Print four feet. Remove any stringing; lightly chamfer or deburr the press-fit edges if needed for a smooth insertion.

<Check>
The foot should seat flush against the extrusion end and not rock.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Apply non-slip pads">
Apply a <strong>1.5" (38 mm)</strong> square non-slip furniture pad to the bottom of each foot.

<Note>
Center the pad so it does not overhang; overhang can peel during lateral loads.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Press-fit into extrusion">
Align the foot with the open end of the 3030 extrusion and press in by hand. Use a soft mallet if necessary—avoid striking the pad surface directly.

<Tip>
If the fit is too tight: lightly sand the outer walls or warm the foot slightly to ease insertion. If too loose: add a single wrap of thin tape to the extrusion end or use a small bead of flexible adhesive.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify stability">
Place the stand on a level surface and push gently from multiple directions to confirm there is no sliding or wobble.

<Check>
All four feet should contact the floor evenly and stay seated after load.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Foot pops out during use">
- Ensure a fully seated press-fit; remove and reinsert with firm pressure.
- Add a thin wrap of painter’s tape to the extrusion end to increase friction.
- For TPU prints, increase wall count or reprint in PETG/PLA+ for a stiffer interface.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Stand still slides on floor">
- Replace worn pads or upgrade to higher-friction furniture pads.
- Clean both floor and pad with isopropyl alcohol to remove dust and oils.
- Consider TPU feet for added grip.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Visible wobble on uneven floors">
- Mix pad thicknesses or add a thin shim under the shortest foot.
- Verify all four feet are fully inserted and flush.
