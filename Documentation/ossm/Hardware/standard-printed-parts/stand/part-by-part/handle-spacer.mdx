## Function

The Handle Spacer provides proper spacing for the adjustment handles. This component:

- Creates the correct offset between the pivot plate and handle knob
- Ensures smooth handle operation without interference
- Provides a finished appearance at the pivot points
- Required for proper assembly of the angle adjustment mechanism

You need **8 Handle Spacers** per stand assembly.
