## Function

The Extrusion Cap provides a finished appearance for exposed extrusion ends. This component:

- Press-fits into the open ends of the 3030 extrusion
- Covers the exposed aluminum profile for safety and aesthetics
- Used on non-floor-contact ends of the extrusion frame
- Provides a clean, professional finish to the stand assembly

You need **6 Extrusion Caps** per stand assembly.
