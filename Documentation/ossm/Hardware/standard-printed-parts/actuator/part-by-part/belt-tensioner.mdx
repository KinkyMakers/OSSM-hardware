## Function

The Belt Tensioner provides adjustable tension for the GT2 timing belt. This component:

- Houses 2x MR115-2RS bearings as an idler pulley system
- Mounts to the rear of the actuator body
- Allows fine adjustment of belt tension via mounting bolts
- Ensures consistent belt engagement with the drive pulley

<Tip>
Proper belt tension is critical for smooth operation. The belt should be taut but not overly tight—you should be able to deflect it slightly with finger pressure.
