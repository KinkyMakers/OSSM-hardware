## Function

The 24mm Clamping Thread - End Effector is the business end of the actuator. This component:

- Features 24mm external threading compatible with all OSSM toy mounting accessories
- Connects to the belt clamp via the MGN12H bearing block
- Provides the interface between the actuator and your chosen toy mount
- Accepts the 24mm Nut - 5 Sided for securing toy mounting adapters

<Warning>
Print this part in the default file orientation. Printing threaded components in other orientations causes structural weakness.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Use 2 raft layers when printing this component to promote better bed adhesion for the threaded section.
