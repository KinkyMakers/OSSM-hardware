## Function

The 24 mm Clamping Thread – End Effector is the business end of the OSSM actuator. It:

- Provides a 24 mm external thread that mates with OSSM toy‑mount adapters and the 24 mm five‑sided nut
- Bolts to the carriage on the MGN12H linear bearing and aligns with the belt clamp
- Transfers thrust from the actuator to the attached toy mount while maintaining axial alignment

## Specifications at a glance

- Threading: 24 mm external, compatible with OSSM 24 mm adapters and 24 mm five‑sided nut
- Mounting interface: MGN12H carriage pattern; mates with OSSM belt clamp on the carriage
- Intended load path: Axial (in line with rail). Avoid side‑loading or prying on the threaded section

<Warning>
Print this part in the default file orientation. Re‑orienting threaded parts weakens layer adhesion and can cause failure under load.
</Warning>

## Printing guidelines

Use these settings as a starting point and adjust for your filament and printer.

- Material: PETG or nylon recommended for toughness; ABS/ASA acceptable with enclosure; avoid PLA for high‑temperature use
- Layer height: 0.16–0.24 mm; use 0.2 mm for best thread quality
- Perimeters (walls): 4–6; top/bottom: 6+
- Infill: 40–60% (gyroid or grid)
- Supports: Not required in the default orientation
- External perimeter speed: slow for clean threads (e.g., ≤ 25 mm/s)

<Tip>
If your slicer supports it, add 2 raft layers or a 6–10 mm brim to improve adhesion under the threaded section.
</Tip>

<Note>
Elephant’s foot on the first layer can interfere with thread starts. Use “elephant foot compensation” (0.1–0.2 mm) or slightly raise your Z‑offset if the nut binds on the first turn.
</Note>

## Post‑processing and fit

- Deburr the first thread with a sharp blade if needed
- “Chase” the threads by slowly threading the 24 mm five‑sided nut on and off a few times
- If the fit is too tight, increase horizontal (XY) expansion by +0.05 to +0.10 mm and reprint; if too loose, reduce by a similar amount
- A light dry PTFE or silicone lubricant on the threads can reduce wear

## Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare the carriage">
Power off the OSSM. Ensure the MGN12H carriage and belt clamp are installed and square on the rail.
</Step>

<Step title="Mount the end effector">
Align the end effector with the MGN12H carriage holes and fasten using the hardware from your OSSM kit. Tighten evenly and verify the face seats flush.
</Step>

<Step title="Attach your adapter">
Thread on your chosen OSSM 24 mm adapter and secure it with the 24 mm five‑sided nut. Hand‑tighten until snug; do not overtighten.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify motion">
Manually slide the carriage to confirm there is no interference. After re‑powering, run a homing cycle and check for smooth travel.

<Check>
The nut should engage smoothly by hand and the assembly should remain rigid under light axial load.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Do not use tools (pliers, wrenches) on the printed nut or threads. Hand‑tighten only to avoid cracking.
</Warning>

## Maintenance

- Inspect threads and the interface to the carriage before use; replace the part if you see cracks or delamination
- Keep threads free of debris; clean with a soft brush
- Re‑check fasteners after the first session and periodically thereafter

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Nut starts but binds after 1–2 turns">
- Likely first‑layer bulge (elephant’s foot). Enable elephant‑foot compensation or lightly chamfer the first thread with a blade.
- Reduce external perimeter speed or lower nozzle temperature for sharper thread definition.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Nut is wobbly or won’t hold position">
- Increase perimeters and infill for a stiffer thread form.
- Reduce horizontal (XY) expansion or scale XY to 99.5% and reprint.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Layer split near the thread root">
- Use a tougher material (PETG/nylon), raise nozzle temperature within spec, and ensure the default orientation.
- Avoid over‑tightening; apply a light dry lubricant to reduce torque.
