## Function

The 24mm Nut - 5 Sided secures toy mounting adapters to the actuator. This component:

- Features internal 24mm threading matching the clamping thread components
- Pentagonal (5-sided) shape for comfortable hand tightening
- Locks toy mounting accessories against the end effector
- Provides quick tool-free attachment and removal of toy mounts

You need **2 of these nuts** per actuator build—one for the belt clamp end and one for the end effector.

<Warning>
Print this part in the default file orientation. Printing threaded components in other orientations causes structural weakness.
</Warning>

<Note>
A hex flower variant is available in the Non-standard folder if you prefer a different grip style.
