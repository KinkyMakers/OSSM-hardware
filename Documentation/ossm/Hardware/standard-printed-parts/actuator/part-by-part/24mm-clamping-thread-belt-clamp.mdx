## Function

The 24mm Clamping Thread - Belt Clamp is a critical motion component. This part:

- Mounts directly to the MGN12H linear rail bearing block
- Clamps both ends of the GT2 timing belt to create a continuous loop
- Features 24mm external threading for the 5-sided nut
- Transfers linear motion from the belt to the end effector

<Warning>
Print this part in the default file orientation. Printing threaded components in other orientations causes structural weakness.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Use 2 raft layers when printing this component to promote better bed adhesion for the threaded section.
</Tip>

<Accordion title="Troubleshooting: Print issues with 24mm Clamping Thread">
If you have issues printing this integrated clamping thread, use the Non-standard 24mm Thread and Belt Clamp files instead. These separate components require additional hardware:

- (Qty 2) M3x8
- (Qty 1) M3x16
- (Qty 3) M3 Hex Nut
