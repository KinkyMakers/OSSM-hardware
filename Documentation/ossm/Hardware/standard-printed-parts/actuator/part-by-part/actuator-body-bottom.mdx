## Function

The Body - Bottom serves as the foundation of the actuator assembly. This component:

- Houses the bearing stack (6x MR115-2RS bearings) that supports the motor shaft
- Provides mounting points for attaching the actuator to the motor ring
- Supports the MGN12H linear rail along its length
- Creates the rear belt routing channel
