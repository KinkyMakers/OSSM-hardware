## Function

The Belt Clamp - Top is part of the two-piece belt clamp assembly. This component:

- Bolts to the Belt Clamp - Bottom to sandwich the belt ends
- Features teeth that engage with the GT2 belt profile for secure grip
- Provides the upper clamping surface to lock the belt in place
- Completes the belt clamp assembly with the bottom piece and 24mm thread

<Note>
This is a non-standard part. Use this alongside the Belt Clamp - Bottom and 24mm Thread when you have difficulty printing the integrated 24mm Clamping Thread parts.
</Note>

## Additional Hardware Required

When using this separate assembly instead of the integrated clamping thread:

| Quantity | Part |
|----------|------|
| 2 | M3x8 Socket Cap Head Bolt |
| 1 | M3x16 Socket Cap Head Bolt |
| 3 | M3 Hex Nut |
