## Function

The 24mm Nut - Hex Flower is an alternative to the standard 5-sided nut. This component:

- Features internal 24mm threading matching the clamping thread components
- Hex flower shape provides multiple grip points for comfortable hand tightening
- Compatible with the included hex flower wrench for additional torque
- Locks toy mounting accessories against the end effector

<Note>
This is a non-standard part. The default build uses the 24mm Nut - 5 Sided instead.
</Note>

<Warning>
Print this part in the default file orientation. Printing threaded components in other orientations causes structural weakness.
</Warning>
