## Function

The Belt Clamp - Bottom is part of the two-piece belt clamp assembly. This component:

- Mounts directly to the MGN12H linear rail bearing block
- Provides the lower clamping surface for the GT2 timing belt
- Accepts the separate 24mm Thread component
- Works with Belt Clamp - Top to secure the belt ends

<Note>
This is a non-standard part. Use this alongside the Belt Clamp - Top and 24mm Thread when you have difficulty printing the integrated 24mm Clamping Thread parts.
</Note>

## Additional Hardware Required

When using this separate assembly instead of the integrated clamping thread:

| Quantity | Part |
|----------|------|
| 2 | M3x8 Socket Cap Head Bolt |
| 1 | M3x16 Socket Cap Head Bolt |
| 3 | M3 Hex Nut |
