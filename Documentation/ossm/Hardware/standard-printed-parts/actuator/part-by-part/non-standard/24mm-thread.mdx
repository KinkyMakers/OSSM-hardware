## Function

The 24mm Thread is a standalone threaded component used with the separate belt clamp parts. This component:

- Provides the 24mm external threading for the nut interface
- Designed to bolt onto the Belt Clamp - Bottom component
- Used when the integrated clamping thread parts are difficult to print
- Requires additional hardware for assembly

<Note>
This is a non-standard part. Use this alongside the Belt Clamp - Bottom and Belt Clamp - Top when you have difficulty printing the integrated 24mm Clamping Thread parts.
</Note>

## Additional Hardware Required

When using this separate assembly instead of the integrated clamping thread:

| Quantity | Part |
|----------|------|
| 2 | M3x8 Socket Cap Head Bolt |
| 1 | M3x16 Socket Cap Head Bolt |
| 3 | M3 Hex Nut |

<Warning>
Print this part in the default file orientation. Printing threaded components in other orientations causes structural weakness.
</Warning>
