## Overview

The Hex Flower Wrench is a compact, printed tool designed to positively engage the 24 mm Hex Flower nut variant used on the OSSM actuator. Use it when you need more control than hand‑tightening provides.

- Interfaces with the Hex Flower pattern for secure grip
- Applies additional torque safely beyond hand-tight
- Aids in controlled loosening without slipping
- Slim profile for easy storage with your OSSM kit

<Note>
This wrench is only needed for the Hex Flower nut variant. The standard 5‑sided nut is intended for hand‑tightening only and does not use this tool.
</Note>

## Compatibility

- Fits: 24 mm Hex Flower nut variant for OSSM
- Does not fit: Standard 5‑sided nut or other non‑Hex Flower profiles

<Tip>
If you are unsure which nut you have, compare your nut’s face to the STL preview above. The Hex Flower nut shows a repeating “flower” contour rather than straight flats.
</Tip>

## Print recommendations

These settings balance strength and print time for a durable tool. Adjust to your printer and filament.

- Material: PETG or ABS/ASA recommended for heat and impact resistance; PLA+ works but is more brittle in high‑torque/warmer environments
- Layer height: 0.20 mm (0.16 mm for tighter dimensional accuracy)
- Perimeters (walls): 4–6
- Top/bottom layers: 6–8
- Infill: 40–60% (Gyroid/Cubic recommended)
- Orientation: Lay the wrench flat on the bed so the Hex Flower face prints upward; this aligns layer lines to resist torque
- Supports: Not required for most slicers; enable only if your preview shows sagging in the cavity
- Adhesion: Skirt or brim as needed for bed adhesion

<Warning>
This is a printed tool. Do not use cheater bars, impact drivers, or power tools. Excessive torque can crack the wrench or damage the nut.
</Warning>

## Prepare and use

<Steps>
<Step title="Slice and print">
  Slice the STL with the settings above and print in PETG/ABS/ASA for best durability.

  <Check>
  The part should come off the bed flat with clean cavity edges and no layer separation.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Deburr and test‑fit">
  Remove any strings or burrs from the Hex Flower cavity. Gently test the fit on the nut without force.

  <Tip>
  If the fit is tight, a light pass with fine sandpaper (320–600 grit) on the cavity walls usually resolves it.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Tighten the nut">
  Seat the wrench fully onto the Hex Flower nut. Hold the mating parts steady and turn the wrench clockwise to snug.

  <Warning>
  Stop at snug‑tight. Printed tools are for moderate torque; over‑tightening can cause cracking.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Loosen the nut">
  To remove, seat the wrench fully and turn counter‑clockwise while supporting the assembly to avoid side‑loading.

  <Check>
  After loosening, inspect the wrench for whitening, cracks, or deformation before using it again.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Care and maintenance

- Inspect before each use for cracks, layer splits, or rounding of the cavity
- Retire and reprint the tool if you see damage or excessive wear
- Store flat, out of direct heat or sunlight to preserve material strength

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Wrench won’t fully seat on the nut">
- Verify you have the Hex Flower nut variant (not the 5‑sided nut)
- Check for print elephants’ foot; lightly chamfer the cavity edge with a knife or sandpaper
- Reduce horizontal expansion/XY compensation in your slicer by 0.05–0.15 mm and reprint
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Wrench slips under torque">
- Ensure the wrench is fully seated before turning
- Increase wall count to 6 and infill to 60% and reprint in PETG/ABS/ASA
- Replace the wrench if the cavity shows rounding or glaze
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Part cracked during use">
- Reprint in a stronger material (ABS/ASA or PETG) with more perimeters and higher infill
- Reorient to print flat (face up) so layers resist torsion
- Reduce applied torque; do not use extensions or power tools
</Accordion>
