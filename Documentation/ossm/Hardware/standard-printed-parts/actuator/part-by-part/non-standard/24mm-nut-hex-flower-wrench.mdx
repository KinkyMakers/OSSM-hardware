## Function

The Hex Flower Wrench is a companion tool for the hex flower nut variant. This component:

- Engages with the hex flower nut pattern for mechanical advantage
- Allows additional tightening torque beyond hand-tight
- Provides tool-assisted loosening when needed
- Compact size for easy storage with your OSSM

<Note>
This wrench is only needed if you use the Hex Flower nut variant. The standard 5-sided nut is designed for hand-tightening only.
