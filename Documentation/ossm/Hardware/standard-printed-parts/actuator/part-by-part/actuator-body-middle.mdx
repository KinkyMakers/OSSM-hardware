## Function

The Body - Middle is the central structural component of the actuator. This component:

- Extends the linear rail mounting surface from the bottom piece
- Contains the primary belt routing channel through the actuator
- Provides the attachment points for the Body - Cover
- Transfers load between the bottom and cover sections

<Warning>
Print this part in the default file orientation. Printing in other orientations causes structural weakness that may lead to failure under load.
</Warning>

<Note>
A pivot variant of this part is available in the Non-standard folder for builds requiring additional adjustment range.
