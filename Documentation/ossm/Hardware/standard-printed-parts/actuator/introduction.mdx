## What you’ll build

This page guides you through preparing printed parts, gathering hardware, and assembling the OSSM linear actuator. By the end, you’ll have a complete actuator ready for belt routing and integration with your mount and electronics.

<Info>
  If you’re assembling a full OSSM, you’ll connect this actuator to your stand and electronics later. For firmware flashing and remote pairing, see <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/flashing-your-ossm">
Flashing your OSSM/RADR</a>

## Printing

Follow these print settings for optimal strength and durability.

### Print settings

| Setting              | Value                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Walls                | 6                     |
| Infill Type          | Cross Hatch or Gyroid |
| Infill Percentage    | 15%                   |
| Supports             | None                  |
| Filament Estimate    | 200g                  |
| Recommended Filament | PLA+                  |

<Warning>
  Print all parts in the default file orientation. Printing threaded components in other orientations causes structural weakness.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  For the 24mm Clamping Thread, use 2 raft layers to improve bed adhesion.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Troubleshooting: 24mm Clamping Thread">
    If you have issues printing the 24mm Clamping Thread, use the Non-standard 24mm Thread and Belt Clamp files instead (available in the source repository). These require additional hardware:

    - (Qty 2) M3x8
    - (Qty 1) M3x16
    - (Qty 3) M3 Hex Nut

<Info>
  Calculate your rail length using this formula: <b>
desired maximum stroke + 180mm</b>

  .

  You must use an MGN<strong>12H</strong>
   rail. The “H” designates a longer bearing block than “C” for greater stability. The “12” indicates a 12mm rail width.

### Before you begin

- Ensure all printed threads are clean and free of stringing. Test-fit the 24mm threaded parts by hand only.
- Lightly deburr belt paths and bearing seats on printed parts as needed.
- Gather metric hex keys and a small flathead screwdriver for set screws and terminal blocks.

<Warning>
  Do not power the actuator until you complete belt routing and verify smooth motion. Avoid forcing the rail carriage—binding indicates misalignment.
</Warning>

### Build steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare the linear rail">
    Verify your rail matches the required spec (MGN12H). Slide the carriage through its full travel; it should feel smooth with no catches.

    <Check>
      Carriage moves freely across the entire rail without binding.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assemble the body stack">
    Position Body - Bottom and Body - Middle. Align mounting holes and loosely fasten the parts so you can make minor adjustments during alignment. Add Body - Cover later after belt routing.

    <Tip>
      Start all screws before tightening to maintain alignment.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install bearings and tensioner">
    Press-fit the MR115-2RS bearings into the Belt Tensioner and any designated idler pockets in the body. The bearings should seat flush and spin freely.

    <Check>
      All bearings are fully seated and rotate without rubbing printed walls.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mount the pulley">
    Fit the 20T GT2 pulley (8mm bore, 10mm width) on the drive shaft and align it with the belt path. Secure set screws against a flat on the shaft if available.

    <Warning>
      Keep the pulley aligned with the belt centerline to prevent tracking issues.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Route the belt (reference images below)">
    Feed the 10mm GT2 belt through the body following the Tensioner → Body → Belt Clamp path. Leave equal tail length at the clamp for final tensioning.

    <Check>
      Belt teeth fully engage pulley teeth; belt is not twisted.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the 24mm clamping interface">
    Assemble the 24mm Clamping Thread - End Effector and Belt Clamp with the two 24mm 5-sided nuts. Hand-tighten only during initial fit.

    <Tip>
      If your print has poor first-layer adhesion on these parts, use a raft (2 layers recommended) and reprint.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set belt tension and close the body">
    Use the Belt Tensioner to remove slack until the belt is taut and tracks true during manual motion. Once satisfied, install the Body - Cover and tighten all hardware progressively.

    <Check>
      With light hand motion, the carriage moves smoothly and returns without skipping teeth.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>
