This section covers the electronics that connect your ESP32 controller to the motor driver. You can choose between the official OSSM PCB or build your own wiring configuration.

## Available Options

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Official OSSM PCB" icon="microchip" href="/ossm/Hardware/PCB/board-design#official-ossm-wiring">
    Purpose-built reference board with integrated level shifting and standardized connections for reliable operation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DIY Wiring" icon="plug" href="/ossm/Hardware/PCB/board-design#alternative-wiring-configurations">

## Choosing Your Approach

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Official PCB">
    The official OSSM PCB provides:
    - Pre-configured GPIO connections
    - Built-in 3.3V to 5V level shifting for reliable high-speed operation
    - JST connectors for clean cable management
    - Tested and validated design

    <Tip>
    The official PCB is recommended for most builders. It simplifies wiring, reduces assembly time, and eliminates common signal integrity issues.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="DIY Wiring">
    Custom wiring is a good choice if you:
    - Want to prototype before committing to a PCB
    - Use a non-standard motor driver
    - Already have components on hand
    - Prefer to understand the system at a component level

    <Warning>
    DIY wiring requires careful attention to voltage levels and signal integrity. You must use a level shifter when connecting a 3.3V ESP32 to a 5V motor driver.

## Key Considerations

Before selecting your approach, understand these critical factors:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Voltage level compatibility">
    Most ESP32 development boards operate at 3.3V logic levels, while many motor drivers expect 5V signals. Without proper level shifting, you may experience:
    - Missed steps at high speeds
    - Unreliable motor communication
    - Potential damage to components

    Always verify the input voltage requirements of your specific motor driver before wiring.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Signal integrity">
    High-speed step signals (up to 200 kHz) require clean wiring to prevent noise and signal degradation:
    - Keep step and direction wires as short as practical
    - Route signal wires away from motor power cables
    - Use twisted pairs or shielded cable for runs longer than 30 cm
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Power supply requirements">
    Your motor driver requires a separate power supply sized for your motor:
    - Servo motors typically need 24-48V DC
    - Stepper motors vary by model (12-48V common)
    - The ESP32 runs from USB or a 5V supply independent of the motor power
