This section explains how the OSSM PCB connects your ESP32-based controller to the motor driver. You can use the official OSSM PCB or create a DIY wiring setup.

## Available Options

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Official OSSM PCB" icon="microchip" href="#official-ossm-wiring">
    Reference board with 5V step/dir outputs, integrated protection, and standardized connectors for reliable operation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DIY Wiring" icon="plug" href="#alternative-wiring-configurations">
    Breadboard or custom harnesses for prototyping or using alternative motor drivers.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Choosing Your Approach

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Official PCB">
    The official OSSM PCB provides:
    - Pre-mapped GPIO to step/dir/enable
    - 3.3V-to-5V signal conversion for high‑speed, noise‑resistant control
    - JST‑PH connectors for tidy cable management
    - Built‑in power and back‑EMF protection
    - A design validated by the OSSM community

    <Tip>
    For most builders, the official PCB is the fastest and most reliable path to success.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="DIY Wiring">
    Choose DIY wiring if you:
    - Want to prototype before committing to a PCB
    - Need to interface with a non‑standard driver
    - Already have compatible parts on hand
    - Prefer to learn the system at the signal level

    <Warning>
    An ESP32 uses 3.3V logic. Many motor drivers expect 5V step/dir signals. Always include a level shifter when wiring directly from an ESP32 to a 5V driver.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Key Considerations

Before you decide, keep these factors in mind:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Voltage level compatibility">
    ESP32 boards operate at 3.3V logic while many drivers use 5V inputs. Without proper level shifting, you may see:
    - Missed steps at higher speeds
    - Unreliable direction changes
    - Risk of damaging components

    Verify input voltage requirements for your specific driver before wiring.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Signal integrity">
    High‑speed step signals (up to 200 kHz) demand clean wiring:
    - Keep step and direction leads short
    - Route signals away from motor power cables
    - Use twisted pairs or shielded cable for runs longer than 30 cm
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Power supply requirements">
    Size the driver supply for your motor:
    - Servo motors commonly use 24–48V DC
    - Stepper drivers vary by model (12–48V typical)
    - Power the ESP32 from USB or a regulated 5V rail, independent of motor power
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Official OSSM wiring

Use this section if you are wiring the OSSM PCB to the OSSM Gold Motor (57AIM series) or a compatible step/dir driver.

<Steps>
<Step title="Gather parts">
  - OSSM PCB
  - 24V power supply (UL‑certified recommended)
  - PH‑4 signal cable and green motor power connector (included with OSSM motor kits)
  - Appropriate motor and driver

  <Note>
  For the OSSM Gold Motor wiring walkthrough, see <a href="/open-source-sex-machine/ossm-electronics/wiring-your-gold-motor">Wiring your Gold Motor</a>.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect motor power">
  - Strip the red/black power leads.
  - Insert red (+) and black (–) into the two‑position motor power terminal on the PCB.
  - Tighten firmly to prevent intermittent connections.

  <Check>
  Tug each wire gently. If it moves, retighten the terminal.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect step/dir signals">
  - Plug the keyed PH‑4 signal cable into the PCB’s 4‑pin header.
  - Route the other end to the motor/driver control input as labeled.

  <Tip>
  The PCB outputs 5V, active‑low step/dir signals on the PH‑4 header, which improves noise immunity with many drivers.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Apply power and verify">
  - Connect the 24V supply to the PCB’s 2.1 mm x 5.5 mm barrel jack.
  - Power on. The motor/driver should indicate power and be ready.

```bash
# Quick preflight
1) Power on the PCB
2) Confirm motor/driver status LED indicates power
3) Connect your controller and home the axis when mechanically assembled
```

  <Check>
  If the remote is connected during bench testing, homing may not complete until the actuator is fully assembled on a rail.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Alternative wiring configurations

If you are interfacing a different step/dir driver or prototyping on a breadboard:

<Steps>
<Step title="Add a level shifter (required for 5V drivers)">
  Use a unidirectional 3.3V→5V level shifter for STEP, DIR, and ENABLE. Tie grounds between the ESP32, level shifter, and driver.

  ```text
  ESP32 (3.3V) → Level Shifter → Driver (5V)
       STEP  ────────────────→  STEP
       DIR   ────────────────→  DIR
       EN    ────────────────→  EN (if used)
       GND   ─────────────────  GND (common)
  ```

  <Warning>
  Do not drive a 5V input directly from an ESP32 pin.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Wire power correctly">
  - Keep motor power separate from 5V logic rails.
  - Size supply wiring for current. Use 16–24 AWG on the PCB motor output terminals.
</Step>

<Step title="Validate signals">
  - Start at a low step rate and increase gradually.
  - Confirm direction changes cleanly and that no steps are missed.
</Step>
</Steps>
