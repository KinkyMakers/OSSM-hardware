Motor Cover for the 60AIM40F. Recommended to only use with a heatsink attached to the back of the motor, where it gets really hot. Connects to armpits experimental 60AIM40F motor ring. For this, you need to replace the Nuts in the motor ring with M5x20 Coupling nuts. Then screw the Cover onto the motor with 4x M5x45 Hex Caps.
