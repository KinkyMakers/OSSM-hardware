A bracket to mount [these](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005006355052746.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.4.5b3d5c5fPcSZQr&gatewayAdapt=glo2deu) suction cups to 4040 extrusion (tested with aluxprofile Type I). The suction Cups are very strong, I use a total of 4 on my shicks mount. This has the big advantage to not loose any stability that comes with the shicks mount whatsover.
Requires one suction cup and one UNC-1/4 20 5/8" screw for each bracket.
