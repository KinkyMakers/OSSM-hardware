### Printing
This print uses PitClamp Mini Standard Settings with a +1 for walls on the `Ring`.

PitClamp Mini Standard Settings:

    6 Walls
    Infill type: Cross Hatch (or gyroid) 10%
    Supports: Normal (Snug) Supports with 3 degree threshold angle. Allow supports on part.
    Seam: Nearest (or your personal preference)
 - **Recommended filament:** PLA+
 - All parts are intended to print in the provided file default orientation. 
   - **Printing the Base components in other orientations will cause structural weakness**

If your printer is well calibrated and your material layer strength is optimal, the print-in-place Upper+Handle is recommended, found in the [/Non-Standard](Non-standard) folder.
