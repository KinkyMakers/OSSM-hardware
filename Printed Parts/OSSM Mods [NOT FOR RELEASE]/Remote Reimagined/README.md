## Summary    
Reimagines the OSSM Remote in single-handed form factor allowing control of Speed and Depth knobs (and click) with just one thumb.  
To be used in the right hand.

"Fail-safe" by still allowing traditional use of both knobs.

### Bill Of Materials
    2x M4-10mm
    ~80mm x ~4mm rubber band

### Notes:
 - Double check ***ALL*** support remnants are cleaned off the screen frame portion of the Board Interface before tightening down
     - Use caution/common-sense when placing the "Board Interface" on, if it feels like it's touching the screen component don't force it.  
Please message me and I will add additional clearance, I'm unsure the clearance needed to cover variance in boards but wanted to keep it tight-ish
 - I found that putting a single twist in the rubberband improves grip between the knobs.
 - There is room for improvement in filament usage and ergonomics for the Bottom, feel free to contribute designs!
