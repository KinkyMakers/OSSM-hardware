## Printing:
  - 0.4mm nozzle (Wider should not cause problems)
  - 0.2mm layer height
  - Standard strength (5 wall) profile
  - 15% gyroid or crosshatch infill

Supports required for:
  - OSSM - Remote Reimagined - Board Interface.stl
  - OSSM - Remote Reimagined - Bottom (any).stl

Recommend "Variable Layer Height" on the top half of "OSSM - Remote Reimagined - Bottom (any).stl  
_*This will help the curves print notably smoother_
