## Printing:
The entire project is intended for:  

    0.4mm nozzle (Wider should not cause problems)
    0.2mm layer height (Necessary for some built-in helper features)
    Standard strength (5 wall) profile
    15% gyroid or crosshatch infill
    Higher infill optional

All parts tested in PLA, PLA+ and PETG  

Check out the [Preconfigured 3mf Files](Preconfigured%203mf%20Files/) directory for slicer files that contain all required parts with support and other print settings preconfigured.  
Just delete the rings that don't apply to your build, select your filament and send the job to your printer.

Supports required for:
  - PitClamp Mini - Common - Handle
  - PitClamp Mini - Base - Standard - Lower
  - PitClamp Mini - Common - Upper
  - PitClamp Mini - Ring - 57AIM
  - PitClamp Mini - Ring - iHSV57

## Rings
### Ring Offsets:
- Default offset is 5mm, this allows for clearance for 3030 and 4040 extrusion and typical rail components.
- **0mm/1mm offsets** are designed to sit close to 3030 extrusion. 
    - Only use this offset if you _really_ need things to be compact on 3030 setups. Can have clearance issues if your setup isn't absolutely perfect.
