# (EXPERIMENTAL) Extrusion Ring

## Summary
Connects to 3030/4040 extrusion to then use in a PitClamp Mini.  
This allows you to make a quick-disconnect motor arm that attaches to any other base.

Intended to be used with Quick Clamp Ratchet base, but be creative!

**Reason for "Experimental" tag:**  
There are known structural weaknesses in this part, they must be addressed.  
Recommended only for lighter use cases at this time.
