# (EXPERIMENTAL) 60AIM40F Motor Ring

## Summary
Allows for use of 60AIM40F motor in PitClamp Mini.

**Reason for "Experimental" tag:**  
While this ring is based on the PitClamp Mini Ring v1.1, it does not contain the same alignment features that support PitClamp Mini Ring v1.1 based mods.  
This ring is subject to change if this motor gains any popularity.

**Status:**
