- **57AIM** *(30/15/10)* 
  - **"Gold Motor"** == **57AIM30** [Recommended]
- **47AIM** *(30/15/10)*
  - **"Round Motor"** == **42AIM30**
- **iHSV57** *(180w/140w/100w)*
  - Note: Smaller than 180w iHSV57 will require modifications to ring
  - This ring is two parts but snaps into two pieces after removing from printer. Clasp each half around the motor to assemble.
  

## Printing
**PitClamp Mini Standard Print Settings:**

    6 Walls
    Infill type: Cross Hatch (or gyroid) 10%
    Supports: Tree Supports with 5 degree threshold angle
    Seam: Nearest (or your personal preference)
 - All parts are intended to print in the provided file default orientation. 
   - **Printing the Base components in other orientations will cause structural weakness**
 - If your printer is well calibrated and your material layer strength is optimal, the print-in-place Upper+Handle is recommended, found in the [/Non-Standard](Non-standard) folder.
