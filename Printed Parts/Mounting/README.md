**Developed by: armpit**

3d printed modular quick-release adjustable and removable mount ecosystem for 57AIM, 42AIM, iHSV57 NEMA23 motors.  
  - 4 degree precision quick-adjustable rotation
  - Motor can be quickly removed from mount for storage or use in another base  

Stress tested to 50 ft-lb without grip being compromised. (PLA 6 walls 10% infill)  

### Supported motors:  
| **57AIM** *(30/15/10)* | **47AIM** *(30/15/10)* | **iHSV57<sup>1</sup>** (180w/140w<sup>2</sup>/100w<sup>2</sup>) |

<sup>1</sup>:The iHSV57 ring is two parts but snaps into two pieces after removing from printer. Clasp each half around the motor to assemble.  
<sup>2</sup>: Smaller than 180w iHSV57 will require modifications to that ring. 


### Printing
**PitClamp Mini Standard Print Settings:**  

    6 Walls
    Infill type: Cross Hatch (or gyroid) 10%
    Supports: Tree Supports with 5 degree threshold angle
    Seam: Nearest (or your personal preference)
 - **Filament estimate:** 150g
 - **Recommended filament:** PLA+
 - All parts are intended to print in the provided file default orientation. 
   - **Printing the Base components in other orientations will cause structural weakness**

**Printed parts:**

    (Qty 1) Mounting Ring - PitClamp Mini - 57AIM V1.1
    (Qty 1) Base - PitClamp Mini - Dogbone Bolts
    (Qty 1) Base - PitClamp Mini - Dogbone Nuts
    (Qty 1) Base - PitClamp Mini - Handle
    (Qty 1) Base - PitClamp Mini - Lower V1.1
    (Qty 1) Base - PitClamp Mini - Upper V1.1

If your printer is well calibrated and your material layer strength is optimal, the print-in-place Upper+Handle is recommended, found in the [/Non-Standard](Non-standard) folder.
