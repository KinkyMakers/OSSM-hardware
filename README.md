# OSSM - Open Source Sex Machine

[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/559409652425687041)](https://discord.gg/wrENMKb3)

OSSM (pronounced like "Awesome") is a user friendly every day sex machine for the people.

This project aims to help people curious about sex machines explore their interest. A second objective is optionally
learning how mechanics, electronics, physics and computing are involved in your sexual pleasure.

Please note that this is a _work in progress_ and we have attempted to keep compatibility with the current BOM going
forward, but it's not guaranteed.

_Our Primary design goals_ are to make a machine that is compact, quiet, of moderate cost, 3D printable (no
cutting/machining required), flexible, highly performant, with easily sourced components, and doesn't look like a giant
machine.

### Software

The software is available in this github repository. It is written and compiled utilizing PlatformIO on Visual Studio
Code. [Reference for working with the code in PlatformIO here](OSSM PlatformIO Readme.md)

We recommend using
the [Research and Desire Reference Board](https://shop.researchanddesire.com/products/ossm-reference-board) as Do It
Yourself by someone without extensive electronics knowledge creates a lot of support overhead. This code is still
arduino IDE compatible but offers many times better performance. Web based control is coming soon. A proof of concept
can be found at [https://app.researchanddesire.com/ossm](https://app.researchanddesire.com/ossm), however modifications need to be made in order to use this proof
of concept web control.

### Eagle PCB

Simple PCB to power an ESP32 (wifi enabled microcontroller) from 24V and breakout the pins for the OSSM control

### Mechanical design

The OSSM use a compact belt design with components that have become widely available due to 3D printing popularity.
It is driven by a Nema23 motor of **your** choosing, although we reccomend small integrated closed loop servos for their
silent operation and very high performance.

### Safety

The safety of the OSSM build is yet to be fully characterized as it is a work in progress. The OSSM is a framework for
building your own sex machine and as such your specific combination may have risks not inherent to other builds. These
risks may be undocumented or undiscovered. Please see the [Hazards](Documentation/Hazards.md) file for more
information.

While using the OSSM we can suggest the following hierarchy of safety, however it is up to you and your build to decide
what risks exist and how to mitigate them.

1. Have ability to move away
2. Have ability to remove the power
3. If you are in bondage, safety is responsibility of the Top

## Bill Of Materials

We are calling this the reference build, when deviating from it please check compatability with existing Bill Of
Materials (BOM)

1.  **[3D Printed Parts](Hardware/OSSM%20Printed%20Parts)**
    - This has recently had significant changes
    - [Make sure to choose one of the options for the toy adapters](Hardware/OSSM%20Printed%20Parts/end%20effector%20options)
    - There are several mounting options available, the most popular being  
      the [Ulanzi Ball head mount](Hardware/OSSM%20Mounting) or  
      the [Shicks mount](Hardware/OSSM%20Mounting/Shicks%204040%20mount)
    - Thank you @Elims for the [belt tensioner design]( https://github.com/theelims )

2.  **IHSV57 NEMA23 Servo with 8mm shaft** _or_ **57AIM30 (Gold Motor)**:
    - **Gold Motor**
      - New standard motor for OSSM, please see [Gold Motor Info](Documentation/Gold-Motor.md) while docs are being updated.
        This motor is cheaper, more compact and has improved features which are being implemented in OSSM firmware.
      - For the latest information about this change, join the KinkyMakers Discord.
    - **iHSV57 (Previous Standard Motor)**
      - _Avoid the StepperOnline version_
      - Make sure you get something with **8mm** shaft.
      - There are **3** sizes of this motor:  
          100W = [iHSV57-30-**10**](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-iHSV57%2525252d30%2525252d10.html)

          140W = [iHSV57-30-**14**](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-iHSV57%2525252d30%2525252d14.html)

          180W = [iHSV57-30-**18**](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-iHSV57%2525252d30%2525252d18.html)

      - We recommend motors with firmware version 6 (shown as `V60x`). Pay attention to
        this, [the firmware version is printed on the label on the side.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/131713378/234460307-1c29c18b-3bb5-4ac9-b66f-0dea9df0acac.png)
        You cannot update the motor firmware. version 5 will work, but it is not as feature rich for potential new
        features.
      - Search around for the best deal for you - we reccommend searching "ihsv57" on Aliexpress.com and choosing the -10
        -14 or -18. Some example listings:

    [Aliexpress - AU](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32840113910.html)

    - Minimum 250mm in length, suggested 350mm
    - Rail length = desired stroke + 180mm
    - Must be MGN12**H** rail - H is a longer car than C which gives greater stability.

7.  **Power Supply**: 24 volt 4-5 amp w/ 2.1mm barrel DC plug

    - Larger motors generally need more power!  
      180W -> 24V 5A suggested minimum  
      140W -> 24V 4A suggested minimum  
      100W -> 24V 4A suggested minimum

    - See the FAQ for more details about power supply sizing based on real world experience of OSSM users.
    - The OSSM will work with small power supplies, but will be limited on maximum force.
    - Ensure the power supply is fully enclosed and shielded to avoid cross talk from electromagnetic interference (like a laptop power supply).
    - Ensure the power supply has the correct approvals for your location - This really helps ensure performance as well! (UL, CE, etc.)
    - It is strongly recommended that you purchase a good quality PSU such as a Meanwell.

8.  **Metric Hex Cap Screws** :  
    [Amazon - CA & US](https://www.amazon.ca/Comdox-500pcs-Socket-Screws-Assortment/dp/B06XQLTLHP)

    [Amazon - AU](https://www.amazon.com.au/VIGRUE-Stainless-Hexagon-Washers-Assortment/dp/B08CK9Y971) (this is a little
    expensive, we are looking for a cheaper alternative)

    - A kit like the ones above will provide what's needed:
    - 4x m5x20
    - 1x m5x12 (can also use m5x20)
    - 10x m3x8
    - 2x m3x16
    - 8x m5 nuts
    - 8x m3 nuts

9.  **ESP32 Development Board**
    - [An official OSSM reference PCB](https://research-and-desire.myshopify.com/collections/all/products/ossm-reference-board)
    - We do not currently have a best suggestion if you are not using a reference board, most generic development boards are the same
    - We have found that the 3.3v boards may miss steps at high speed, so please use a level shifter as well.
    - To start working on the project, something like this [Adafruit board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405) is an excellent place to start.
    - Accessories required for prototyping
      include [Breadboard](https://www.amazon.ca/Breadboard-Solderless-Prototype-Distribution-Connecting/dp/B01EV6LJ7G/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=breadboard&qid=1627823170&sr=8-5)
