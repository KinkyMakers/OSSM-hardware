# PitClamp Mini

## Summary

Developed by: armpit

3d printed modular quick-release adjustable and removable mount ecosystem for 57AIM, 42AIM, iHSV57 NEMA23 motors.\
Stress tested to 50 ft-lb without grip being compromised. (PLA 6 walls 10% infill)

### Supported motors:

* **57AIM** _(30/15/10)_
  * **"Gold Motor"** == **57AIM30** \[Recommended]
* **47AIM** _(30/15/10)_
  * **"Round Motor"** == **42AIM30**
* **iHSV57** _(180w/140w/100w)_
  * Note: Smaller than 180w iHSV57 will require modifications to ring
  * This ring is two parts but snaps into two pieces after removing from printer. Clasp each half around the motor to assemble.

## Printing

**PitClamp Mini Standard Print Settings:**

```
6 Walls
Infill type: Cross Hatch (or gyroid) 10%
Supports: Tree Supports with 5 degree threshold angle
Seam: Nearest (or your personal preference)
```

* All parts are intended to print in the provided file default orientation.
  * **Printing the Base components in other orientations will cause structural weakness**
* If your printer is well calibrated and your material layer strength is optimal, the print-in-place Upper+Handle is recommended, found in the [/Non-Standard](../../../Printed%20Parts/Mounting/PitClamp%20Mini/Non-standard/) folder.

v1.1 Ring (only available for 57AIM) can use M5 Hex Nuts or M5 Hex Coupling Nuts (20mm) and has ridges for an interlocking connection to an optional rear motor cover when using Coupling Nuts.\
**This is the recommended setup.**

Ring offset is +5mm from the face of the PitClamp Mini Base.\
Standardized after testing for clearance against various rail tensioners and 3030/4040 extrusion alignment.
