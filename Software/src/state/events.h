/**
* @file events.h
* @brief Defines events for the OSSM state machine.
*
* This file contains the definitions of events used in the OSSM state machine.
* Events are instances of certain occurrences or changes in the system that can trigger
* state transitions in the state machine.
*
* The events in this file are used in the transition table of the OSSMStateMachine class,
* which is defined in state.h. They are used to trigger transitions between different states
* of the state machine.
*
* For example, the `ButtonPress` event represents a button press action, and the `LongPress`
* event represents a long press action. The `Done` event signifies the completion of a task,
* and the `Error` event signifies an error occurrence.
*
* These events are used in conjunction with the Boost SML library, which is a lightweight,
* header-only state machine library for C++.
