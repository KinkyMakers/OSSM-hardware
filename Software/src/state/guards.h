/**
* @file guards.h
* @brief Defines guard conditions for the OSSM state machine.
*
* This file contains the definitions of guard conditions used in the OSSM state machine.
* Guard conditions are predicates that determine whether a transition should be taken
* in response to an event. They are defined as functions or functors that take the necessary
* parameters and return a boolean value.
*
* The guards in this file are used in the transition table of the OSSMStateMachine class,
* which is defined in state.h. They are used to add conditional logic to the state machine's
* transitions.
*
* For example, the `isPreflightSafe` guard checks if the speed percentage is zero, and the
* `isOption` guard checks if a certain menu option is selected.
*
* These guards are used in conjunction with the Boost SML library, which is a lightweight,
* header-only state machine library for C++.
