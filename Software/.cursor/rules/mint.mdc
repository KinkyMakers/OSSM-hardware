## Content quality standards

### Code examples requirements

- Always include complete, runnable examples that users can copy and execute
- Show proper error handling and edge case management
- Use realistic data instead of placeholder values
- Include expected outputs and results for verification
- Test all code examples thoroughly before publishing
- Specify language and include filename when relevant
- Add explanatory comments for complex logic
- Never include real API keys or secrets in code examples

### API documentation requirements

- Document all parameters including optional ones with clear descriptions
- Show both success and error response examples with realistic data
- Include rate limiting information with specific limits
- Provide authentication examples showing proper format
- Explain all HTTP status codes and error handling
- Cover complete request/response cycles

### Accessibility requirements

- Include descriptive alt text for all images and diagrams
- Use specific, actionable link text instead of "click here"
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy starting with H2
- Provide keyboard navigation considerations
- Use sufficient color contrast in examples and visuals
- Structure content for easy scanning with headers and lists

## Component selection logic

- Use **Steps** for procedures and sequential instructions
- Use **Tabs** for platform-specific content or alternative approaches
- Use **CodeGroup** when showing the same concept in multiple programming languages
- Use **Accordions** for progressive disclosure of information
- Use **RequestExample/ResponseExample** specifically for API endpoint documentation
- Use **ParamField** for API parameters, **ResponseField** for API responses
- Use **Expandable** for nested object properties or hierarchical information
